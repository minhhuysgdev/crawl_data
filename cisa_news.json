Supply Chain Integrity Month provides an opportunity for government, industry, and other stakeholders to increase collaboration and the sharing of best practices, risk mitigation strategies, and innovative solutions to safeguard supply chains from threats such as cyberattacks, counterfeiting, and disruptions.  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is positioned to synchronize and emphasize interagency and private sector collaboration and amplify common goals.    ICT is critical to U.S. economic and national security, as it supports all U.S. critical infrastructure and encompasses a wide range of hardware, software, and services. That is why the security and resilience of ICT supply chains is important to the seamless operation and reliability of U.S. critical infrastructure.   This year, CISA is promoting resources, tools, and information along four themes that help partners and stakeholders increase ICT supply chain resilience. Those themes for each week of April include:        Week 1: Preparedness: Building an Effective Supply Chain Risk Management Program    As the use of ICT continues to accelerate and expand, so will the attack surface for adversaries seeking to steal, compromise, alter, or destroy sensitive information.   This week, CISA is reminding everyone to go back to basics and apply actionable cybersecurity and supply chain risk management steps to strengthen their ICT supply chains. The Supply Chain Risk Management Essentials Guide provides leaders and staff with a refresher on basic SCRM practices to improve their overall security resilience.     Week 2: Mitigation: Knowing and Mitigating Against Supply Chain Threats   Conducting supply chain risk management threat analysis and evaluation is a crucial process for identifying vulnerabilities that could disrupt operations, compromise security, or impact business continuity.

      "title": "Unlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data",
      "url": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/unlocking-vulnrichment-enriching-cve-data",
      "author": "Tod Beardsley, CISA Vulnerability Response Section Chief\n\n\n Related topics: \n\nCybersecurity Best Practices \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn today’s fast-paced cybersecurity landscape, staying ahead of vulnerabilities is a daily race against time. Every day, dozens to hundreds of new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are published, many of which affect critical systems. But let’s face it, simply knowing a vulnerability exists is rarely enough to act. As cybersecurity practitioners, researchers, and defenders, we need context. We need clarity. And most importantly, we need actionable insights that can help prioritize patching efforts and mitigate risks. To that end, you may recall CISA’s May 10, 2024 announcement establishing Vulnrichment, our initiative to supercharge CVE data with context, scoring, and analysis that go beyond the basics. This post is a mid-year check-in to briefly cover the how’s and why’s of this effort, now that we’ve been running it for a few months.A Power-Up for CVE DataIf you’re an IT defender or a vulnerability management pro, CISA’s Vulnrichment project can make your life easier. It enriches basic CVE data with actionable insights like Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) decision points, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs, and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), all bundled into the CVE records you’re already pulling. Think of it as a turbocharged upgrade to the CVE data you’re already consuming. Best part? You don’t need to set up anything new—this enriched data is automatically baked into the CVE feeds you’re already using.You’re soaking in it!Today, all Vulnrichment data ends up in the Authorized Data Publisher (ADP) container for individual CVEs, so if you’re pulling CVE data from https://cve.org via the API, or from GitHub at https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5 ,  you’re already collecting Vulnrichment data. It’s just a matter of parsing it out. Here’s an example:This is for CVE-2023-45727, selected because it’s a recent KEV entry that has a full Vulnrichment ADP container. Let’s say you wanted to query the “Exploitation” field of the CISA-provided SSVC decision points. You’d iterate over the ADP container, look for the Vulnrichment ADP container, look for the SSVC decision point, and then return the value for “exploitation.” Using the command line tool jq as an example, that might look like this:jq -r '.containers.adp[] | select(.title == \"CISA ADP Vulnrichment\") | .metrics[]?.other? | select(.type == \"ssvc\") | .content.options[]? | select(.Exploitation) | .Exploitation' CVE-2023-45727.jsonactiveThis query will return one of “active,” “poc,” or “none.” Found a problem?Let’s say you’re happily parsing all this Vulnrichment data, but you found a mistake in one, like the wrong CWE assigned in the Vulnrichment container. Taking CVE-2023-45727 again as the example, let’s pretend that CISA accidentally assigned CWE-610, “Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere,” when it really should be CWE-611, “Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference.” Instead of just gnashing your teeth and wondering how we could be so foolish, you are invited to open an issue at GitHub (specifically, at https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues ) and tell us about it, like so:We take our inbound issues pretty seriously and aim to have them resolved quickly. These kinds of bug reports make Vulnrichment not only an authoritative source of truth about CVEs, but a responsive source, as well.The Value of VulnrichmentIf you’re consuming CVE data – and if you’ve read this far, chances are pretty good you are – you’re probably already using the regular CVE APIs. But, unless you’re parsing out the ADP container, you’re missing out on some key benefits. Here’s why:Clarity and Actionability: CVE data can be… a bit sparse. Simply knowing that a vulnerability exists doesn’t tell you whether it’s been exploited in the wild, if user interaction is required to exploit it, or what vectors are available to attackers. With Vulnrichment, CISA adds broad context in the form of SSVC decision points that help you understand the exploitability, impact, and automatability of a vulnerability. This additional layer of intelligence lets you prioritize remediation based on actual threat risk.Prioritization On Easy Mode: With Vulnrichment, vulnerabilities are enriched with actionable data points like Exploitability (Is there a public exploit? Is it actively being used in the wild?), Technical Impact (Is this vulnerability likely to grant full control over your system, or mere information disclosure?) and Automatability (Can attackers exploit this vulnerability at will, or does it require some setup every time?). This makes the question of “What should I patch first?” a whole lot easier to answer.

      "content": "Unlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nDynamic resource to help level up your vulnerability management program\nBy Tod Beardsley, CISA Vulnerability Response Section Chief\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn today’s fast-paced cybersecurity landscape, staying ahead of vulnerabilities is a daily race against time. Every day, dozens to hundreds of new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are published, many of which affect critical systems. But let’s face it, simply knowing a vulnerability exists is rarely enough to act. As cybersecurity practitioners, researchers, and defenders, we need context. We need clarity. And most importantly, we need\nthat can help prioritize patching efforts and mitigate risks.\nTo that end, you may recall CISA’s May 10, 2024 announcement establishing\n, our initiative to supercharge CVE data with context, scoring, and analysis that go beyond the basics.\nis a mid-year check-in to briefly cover the how’s and why’s of this effort, now that we’ve been running it for a few months.\nA Power-Up for CVE Data\nIf you’re an IT defender or a vulnerability management pro, CISA’s Vulnrichment project can make your life easier. It enriches basic CVE data with actionable insights like Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (\n) decision points, Common Weakness Enumeration (\n) IDs, and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (\n), all bundled into the CVE records you’re already pulling. Think of it as a turbocharged upgrade to the CVE data you’re already consuming. Best part? You don’t need to set up anything new—this enriched data is automatically baked into the CVE feeds you’re already using.\nYou’re soaking in it!\nToday, all Vulnrichment data ends up in the Authorized Data Publisher (\ncontainer for individual CVEs, so if you’re pulling CVE data from\nvia the API, or from GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5\n,  you’re already collecting Vulnrichment data. It’s just a matter of parsing it out. Here’s an example:\nThis is for CVE-2023-45727, selected because it’s a recent KEV entry that has a full Vulnrichment ADP container. Let’s say you wanted to query the “Exploitation” field of the CISA-provided SSVC decision points. You’d iterate over the ADP container, look for the Vulnrichment ADP container, look for the SSVC decision point, and then return the value for “exploitation.” Using the command line tool\nas an example, that might look like this:\njq -r '.containers.adp[] | select(.title == \"CISA ADP Vulnrichment\") | .metrics[]?.other? | select(.type == \"ssvc\") | .content.options[]? | select(.Exploitation) | .Exploitation' CVE-2023-45727.json\nThis query will return one of “active,” “poc,” or “none.”\nLet’s say you’re happily parsing all this Vulnrichment data, but you found a mistake in one, like the wrong CWE assigned in the Vulnrichment container. Taking CVE-2023-45727 again as the example, let’s pretend that CISA accidentally assigned CWE-610, “Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere,” when it really should be CWE-611, “Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference.” Instead of just gnashing your teeth and wondering how we could be so foolish, you are invited to open an issue at GitHub (specifically, at\nhttps://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues\n) and tell us about it, like so:\nWe take our inbound issues pretty seriously and aim to have them resolved quickly. These kinds of bug reports make Vulnrichment not only an authoritative source of truth about CVEs, but a responsive source, as well.\nThe Value of Vulnrichment\nIf you’re consuming CVE data – and if you’ve read this far, chances are pretty good you are – you’re probably already using the regular CVE APIs. But, unless you’re parsing out the ADP container, you’re missing out on some key benefits. Here’s why:\nClarity and Actionability\n: CVE data can be… a bit sparse. Simply knowing that a vulnerability exists doesn’t tell you whether it’s been exploited in the wild, if user interaction is required to exploit it, or what vectors are available to attackers. With Vulnrichment, CISA adds broad context in the form of\nthat help you understand the exploitability, impact, and automatability of a vulnerability. This additional layer of intelligence lets you prioritize remediation based on actual threat risk.\nPrioritization On Easy Mode\n: With Vulnrichment, vulnerabilities are enriched with actionable data points like\n(Is there a public exploit? Is it actively being used in the wild?),\n(Is this vulnerability likely to grant full control over your system, or mere information disclosure?) and\n(Can attackers exploit this vulnerability at will, or does it require some setup every time?). This makes the question of “What should I patch first?” a whole lot easier to answer. These all come under the “SSVC” section of the ADP container, which you can learn more about at\nhttps://cisa.gov/ssvc\n, as well as a future blog post dedicated to CISA’s use and advocacy for SSVC!\nConfidence in Your Data\n: Vulnrichment ensures that the CVE data you’re working with is more accurate and complete. If the data provided by the original CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) didn’t provide some key data points, CISA fills in the gaps, adding CWE Identifiers and CVSS scores when it’s possible to determine those. If the CVE is later updated by the issuing CNA with more direct information, CISA’s contribution will be removed to avoid confusing conflicts. All of this is to say that when you’re looking at fresh CVE data, you know you’re always working with the best available intelligence about those vulnerabilities.\nFriends, Admins, and Countrymen: Lend me your eyes!\n“Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow,” quipped Eric S.

      "author": "giving voice to its citizens, American democracy embodied our Nation’s independence, strength, and commitment to charting a new path, determined by the will of the American people. Over the past 238 years, this sacred electoral process has been tested time and again by foreign adversaries, wars, natural disasters, and disruptive technologies. And our democracy has not only prevailed, but, inspiringly, it has strengthened and evolved. As a Nation, we have embraced that all American citizens—regardless of race or gender—have the right to vote; and, we have adopted technology that enhances the accessibility, accuracy, efficiency, and security of the electoral process. This is our Nation’s unwavering commitment to form a more perfect Union. The foundation of this process is our state and local election officials, the public servants standing on the frontlines of democracy. They have been trusted to deliver free and fair elections since the dawn of the republic. And with each passing election cycle, the threat landscape has grown exponentially more complex. In the wake of Russian efforts to influence and interfere with our democratic process in 2016, Americans became much more aware that the thing that makes our country so great, our democracy, is also a prime target for adversaries seeking to undermine America on a global stage. It was through this lens, that we realized that asking state and local election officials to take on nation-states like Russia, China, Iran, and an entire ecosystem of cybercriminal gangs on their own gave our adversaries an advantage. This recognition led the federal government to designate election infrastructure as national critical infrastructure in 2017. This designation empowered and enabled the federal government to work with election officials and election vendors to strengthen the security and resilience of election infrastructure. Today, CISA serves as the lead for the federal government’s election infrastructure security efforts. We coordinate the efforts of the federal interagency and help election officials and vendors understand the threat environment, access critical resources, and defend against threats to election infrastructure. As we entered the 2024 election cycle, we faced the most challenging threat environment to date. Domestically, dozens of election offices received mail containing suspicious white powder, some laced with fentanyl, a potentially lethal drug. Election officials of both parties were swatted at their homes, putting themselves, their families and first responders in danger. In the lead up to November, there were multiple instances of ballot drop boxes being damaged or destroyed by incendiary devices; ransomware actors targeted election vendors and state and local election offices; and cybercriminals conducted distributed denial of service attacks targeting election related organizations and websites. We also observed the most aggressive use of foreign malign influence campaigns in an election cycle, largely led by Russia and Iran. While our foreign adversaries leveraged different tactics, they shared the same two goals: undermining the American people’s confidence in the security of the democratic process and sowing partisan division in American society. In the run up to Election Day we observed multiple Russian influence campaigns leveraging staged videos alleging attacks on the security and integrity of election infrastructure and processes in what some forecasted to be the most closely contested states. Despite these challenges, state and local election officials courageously met the moment and performed SUPERBLY. They delivered the most secure and resilient election in our Nation’s history. We at CISA were honored to help them secure our democratic process.  Throughout the 2024 election cycle, CISA worked with election officials of both parties in every state and territory across the country to provide more physical and cyber security services to more jurisdictions than ever before. Recognizing election officials have different needs and demanding schedules, we knew we needed to scale our efforts to ensure maximum access to our resources and tools. We introduced our #PROTECT2024 campaign—a suite of products, services, and trainings for the election security community to help them more easily and effectively prioritize the security and resilience of election infrastructure while simultaneously administering elections. Our #PROTECT2024 webpage served as a central hub for CISA’s election security threat information, product releases, and public notifications.In the field, CISA had already established a significant local presence across the country with existing staff like our cybersecurity advisors and physical security advisors, but we knew that election infrastructure had very specialized security requirements that required unique expertise and dedicated support. To meet this need, we built on our existing field presence, adding an election security advisor to each of our 10 regions. This incredible team of public servants and executive leaders brought over 210 years of election administration and election technology experience to the CISA team. Their leadership helped drive our expanded support across the country in unprecedented ways. Working side-by-side with election officials, we recognized that physical security at election offices was a real concern. To help meet this need, we cross-trained over 100 of our security inspectors to conduct physical security assessments on election infrastructure. This increase in capacity enabled us to deliver nearly 1,300 physical security assessments of election facilities during the 2024 election cycle—an unprecedented number for the Agency. This work helped ensure the physical safety of election officials and the physical security of Americans as they exercised their right to vote.  We also worked hard with election security stakeholders to move cybersecurity forward. For the 2024 election cycle, we conducted over 700 cyber assessments for election infrastructure stakeholders and provided weekly internet facing cyber vulnerability assessments to nearly 1,000 election stakeholders. While everyone worked tirelessly to enhance security measures, we also knew things were still going to happen, especially given the complexity of the threat environment, and incident response preparation would be crucial. We focused heavily on delivering trainings and exercises that addressed the full spectrum of threats and practiced realistic incident response. During the 2024 election cycle, CISA conducted 200 tabletop training exercises with the election security community. This included our seventh annual Tabletop the Vote exercise, co-hosted by CISA and the National Association of State Election Directors and National Association of Secretaries of State. This exercise included more than 1,250 participants from dozens of states and territories and a wide range of federal government partners. We also delivered over 500 trainings reaching tens of thousands of election officials and their state, local and federal partners.Perhaps most importantly, CISA, alongside our federal government partners, also took important steps to counter efforts by our foreign adversaries to undermine trust and confidence in the American democratic process. CISA developed publicly available security guidance for election officials that addressed tactics and techniques employed in foreign adversary influence operations. Many of these materials were developed in partnership with our FBI and intelligence community partners. We wanted election infrastructure stakeholders to be more aware and better postured to identify and respond when these incidents happened. Because we knew they were coming. And we were right. A major part of this effort were the five joint public notifications issued by CISA, FBI and ODNI identifying specific information campaigns by Russia and Iran focused on undermining the security and integrity of our election process. We did this to raise the awareness of the American public, the target of these influence operations, to help people understand what they were seeing and who was responsible. We pointed Americans to their state and local election officials, who lead the administration of elections, as the authoritative sources for accurate election security-related information. This election cycle again made clear that our democracy remains a target of our foreign adversaries. As a federal government, we are committed to defending election infrastructure against all threats, including those posed by foreign influence operations. The American people should not have to face these threats on their own and our foreign adversaries should never have the advantage.Election security is national security.We at CISA are proud to support the election heroes who serve on the frontlines of our democracy. As CISA’s Senior Executive overseeing our election security mission, I witnessed incredible collaboration across the security ecosystem during this past election cycle. Thousands of dedicated Americans showed patriotism with their unrelenting dedication to the mission. I am forever grateful to have worked alongside them. It is because of the tireless efforts of the election community, we can affirm that we do not have evidence of any malicious activity that had any material impact on the security or integrity of the 2024 general election outcome. Election officials ran the most secure and resilient election yet in our Nation’s history.  Their collective efforts to secure the 2024 elections proved, once again, that Americans can have unwavering confidence that the outcome of the election reflects without a doubt the will of the American people. And it is not because the process does not face threats, but because of the incredible actions taken across federal, state, and local government to counter those threats and ensure the security and integrity of American democracy.In a few days, CISA and other agencies will prepare for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration. While the 2024 election is over, the election security mission is not. The threat landscape confronting our democracy will continue to evolve in ways we can’t even begin to imagine today. So just as our nation has done since its inception, we will adapt and fiercely protect our democratic process. Elections are political, election security is not. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 15, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nA Message to Election Officials from CISA Director Jen Easterly\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 09, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nCISA Director Jen Easterly Remarks at the Election Center 39th Annual National Conference in Detroit\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 15, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nRegion 10 Team Provides Vital Election Security Training for Idaho\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nOpening Statement by CISA Director Jen Easterly at the Update on Foreign Threats to the 2024 Elections Hearing \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

In our interconnected world, securing our nation’s critical infrastructure requires the collective effort of government, private sector, and international partners. Operational collaboration is the engine driving these efforts. Done right, it brings together partners from diverse backgrounds to achieve what no single entity could accomplish alone. This broad network of expertise allows us to understand and share the best threat information, strategic guidance, and cybersecurity practices that address risks at scale. In addition to synchronizing the national response to major cyber incidents and campaigns, these partnerships also enable better prevention, resilience, and long-term defense. Ongoing Information Exchange and Outreach Our collaboration efforts are field tested almost every day. From the geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the early 2024 vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways, to the CrowdStrike global outage and ongoing campaign activity from malicious cyber actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China, collaboration across the public and private sectors has been a game changer for homeland defense. In each situation, we worked side-by-side with partners to share information and actionable guidance to help unify our collective defense against cyber threats. For instance, in advance of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, CISA launched the Shields Up campaign to help prepare our industry, State, and local partners for potential threats. We began a comprehensive outreach campaign that included dozens of classified and unclassified briefings, produced several joint advisories, alerts, and other information products. We exchanged critical technical information with key partners to ensure they were prepared to protect their systems from potential Russian state-sponsored cyber activity. Separately, when dealing with the Ivanti vulnerabilities, our collaboration resulted in the publication of novel threat information, which we released in a Cybersecurity Advisory that included input from several private sector partners.Beyond high-profile campaigns, our day-to-day collaboration produces tangible results. We work closely with experts to address systemic vulnerabilities, respond to ongoing threats across multiple platforms, and share indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures related to malicious activity and actors. This information sharing helps CISA and our partners proactively identify risks, coordinate responses, and develop mitigation strategies. Daily collaboration with our partners has also made it possible for us to stall or circumvent malicious activity, as seen during the ESXIArgs ransomware campaign when CISA released a recovery script for entities encrypted by the threat actor. Sharing Critical Cybersecurity Insights: Advisories, Alerts, and PublicationsWorking with our partners, CISA has led the global community into a new model for producing world-class cybersecurity guidance. Leaning on operational collaboration through the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), our joint products deliver timely, authoritative, and actionable information and resources for cyber defenders.  In 2024, CISA released over 1,300 products, including cyber defense alerts, advisories, and other content. Over 90% of our Cybersecurity Advisories were jointly sealed with our partners. Notably, through the JCDC we co-sealed products with a number of new CISA partners, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Estonia, Finland, and Sweden. With our NSA and FBI partners, we were also able to co-seal documents and further our already robust collaborative efforts with our cybersecurity counterparts in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, and France, among others. These publications provide organizations with critical insights and actionable recommendations to bolster the defenses of critical infrastructure world-wide.Driving Cyber Resilience Through Prevention Our partnerships make it possible for us to enhance our collective cyber posture by focusing on preparedness and prevention efforts. Through CISA-led tabletop exercises and technical exchanges, as well as the development of cyber defense plans, we have been able to raise the collective cyber posture across sectors. We routinely lead technical exchanges with our partners to harmonize public and private responses to complex threats, like countering ransomware actors or thwarting advanced persistent threat campaigns. We also hosted six technical exchanges and led two tabletop exercises in 2024 alone with the open-source software (OSS) community. The tabletop exercise was created by CISA after the CISA OSS Security Summit in March and put to the test for a second time at the Apache Foundation’s Community Over Code conference in October.  Furthermore, since 2021, CISA completed the development of 12 cyber defense plans tailored to specific risks, including:Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) Security: Partnering with industry experts, we worked to create an RMM Cyber Defense Plan to enhance the security of RMM tools, which are widely used in IT infrastructure. These efforts focused on improving detection capabilities and securing the remote management tools that are critical to many organizations’ operations.Cyber Defense for Geopolitical Crises: In collaboration with federal agencies and industry partners, we developed cyber defense plans tailored to specific geopolitical risks, such as conflicts involving Israel and threats tied to China. These plans provide a framework for organizations to safeguard their operations during times of heightened international tension and work with government partners in unified response.Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security: More than 150 AI and cybersecurity experts from government, industry, and critical infrastructure participated in two tabletop exercises to simulate and address AI-security incidents, providing critical insights that shaped the playbook. Recognizing AI’s transformative potential and inherent risks, we launched an initiative culminating in the AI Cybersecurity Collaboration Playbook—a practical guide for public and private organizations facing AI-driven cyber incidents. OSS Security: Using the lessons learned from the aforementioned Open-Source technical exchanges and tabletop exercises, we developed an Open Source Software Security Roadmap to foster public-private collaboration to address OSS vulnerabilities and enhance the security of widely used software, guiding stakeholders toward best practices that protect both developers and end users.These joint initiatives are not isolated efforts but part of an ongoing strategy to ensure that cyber defenses evolve in tandem with the threat landscape. You can visit our Success Stories webpage to read more examples of how our collaboration with partners is leading to actionable insight and tangible results.Empowering Communities with Cybersecurity ResourcesCISA’s commitment to collaboration also extends to include regional engagement. Our field teams, which include cybersecurity, protective security, and election security advisors, are embedded across the nation, offering support and services directly to state and local organizations.In 2024, more than 2,300 organizations took part in our Cyber Hygiene program, which includes services like vulnerability scanning, cyber hygiene, assessments, and training programs. These programs help organizations, from small businesses to critical infrastructure operators, bolster their security measures and build resilience from the ground up. The strength of our partnerships is our greatest asset. None of our achievements would be possible without the dedication and trust of the organizations and individuals we work with. Together, we are building a more secure cyber ecosystem, ensuring the safety and resilience of the critical infrastructure that powers our daily lives.DISCLAIMERThe information in this blog post is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

      "content": "United in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nBy Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Jeff Greene\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nAt CISA, collaboration is the foundation of our mission. In our interconnected world, securing our nation’s critical infrastructure requires the collective effort of government, private sector, and international partners.\nOperational collaboration is the engine driving these efforts. Done right, it brings together partners from diverse backgrounds to achieve what no single entity could accomplish alone. This broad network of expertise allows us to understand and share the best threat information, strategic guidance, and cybersecurity practices that address risks at scale. In addition to synchronizing the national response to major cyber incidents and campaigns, these partnerships also enable better prevention, resilience, and long-term defense.\nOngoing Information Exchange and Outreach\nOur collaboration efforts are field tested almost every day. From the geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the early 2024 vulnerabilities in\nIvanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways\nCrowdStrike global outage\nand ongoing campaign activity from malicious cyber actors affiliated with the\nPeople’s Republic of China\n, collaboration across the public and private sectors has been a game changer for homeland defense. In each situation, we worked side-by-side with partners to share information and actionable guidance to help unify our collective defense against cyber threats. For instance, in advance of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, CISA launched the\ncampaign to help prepare our industry, State, and local partners for potential threats. We began a comprehensive outreach campaign that included dozens of classified and unclassified briefings, produced several joint advisories, alerts, and other information products.

Specifically, the report calls for software-controlled systems that can be assessed to verify functionality, safety, and security across all conditions, which is currently not available.\nMission owners and operators lack adequate capabilities for software understanding because technology manufacturers build software that greatly outstrips the ability to understand it. The inadequate understanding leads to exploited software vulnerabilities because technology manufacturers create software that is not secure by design.\n“Recent discoveries of adversarial state-sponsored activity in\nUS critical infrastructure\nTransportation Systems\nWater and Wastewater Systems\n– pose imminent threats to US national security. The software understanding gap exacerbates the risk to this threat activity,” said\nCISA Technical Director Chris Butera\n. “Mission owners and operators have an enormous and accelerating dependence on the software underwriting U.S. critical infrastructure. With our partners, we urge the USG to close this gap before other nations and urge software manufactures to align to Secure by Design principles.”\nThe report highlights potential solutions to change the security posture of legacy and future software. One example is the application of mathematically rigorous techniques known as formal methods. For a long time, formally verified software has seemed hopelessly out of reach, but advances by DARPA and others over the past decade have made formal approaches more accessible for mainstream practice.\n“We have the tools today to greatly reduce the number of software vulnerabilities that plague our software infrastructure,” said\nDARPA’s Information Innovation Office Director, Kathleen Fisher\n. “Rapid action to implement these tools in legacy and future systems can dramatically reduce the United States’ cyber vulnerabilities ahead of future global conflicts.”\nThis report also provides recommendations to obtain a deep, scalable understanding of software-controlled systems, including AI-based systems. By providing an adequate capacity for software understanding, the United States will secure an advantage in geopolitics for the foreseeable future and will help harden critical infrastructure against state-sponsored activity.\nThis report highlights the enduring broad government coordination required to create the capabilities to address these threats.\nFor more information on Secure by Design, visit\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

From weathering the Great Depression and mobilizing to support the Allied victory in World War II, to enhancing homeland security after 9/11 and the unprecedented response to COVID-19, the U.S. has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to adapt, to change, to endure moments of crisis, and to respond and recover. We must again embrace national resilience as we navigate a new era of disruptive change and risk posed by People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russian nation state actors, extreme weather, and technological revolutions. These dynamics threaten the reliable operation of critical infrastructure that businesses, our national security, and local communities rely upon every day. How fast, decisively, and collectively we adapt to and build resilience to these challenges will have an outsized impact on American prosperity for the remainder of the 21st Century. As the National Coordinator for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, CISA has played a central role in forging resilience—from COVID-19 to incidents of domestic terrorism and targeted violence to unrelenting criminal cyberattacks against businesses across the nation to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Ukraine war in particular not only demonstrates how adversaries increasingly use “gray zone” and “hybrid” warfare to target critical infrastructure and sow chaos, but also how democratic nations and alliances can successfully be resilient against disruptive aggression. CISA’s ongoing operational collaboration with Ukraine and other partners on the front lines of these attacks, including technical exchanges focused on resilience, provide lessons learned and inspiration that strengthen our resolve to achieve the Agency’s vision of “Secure and Resilient Critical Infrastructure for the American People.” PRC cyber aggression most acutely demonstrates why we must embrace national resilience with more urgency. The stakes could not be higher, because the PRC and other actors no longer just spy and steal business, defense, and consumer data; they now deploy sophisticated campaigns to infiltrate, hijack, or destroy key critical infrastructures like ports, energy grids, water systems, and communications that would disrupt our ability – civilian and military – to respond to crises and simultaneously sow chaos throughout society. We all rely on these key systems, whether senior government officials, business executives, school and hospital administrators, or individuals and families. But in this era of disruptive change, the increasing interconnectedness of our cyber and physical systems means infrastructure systems that served as a highly reliable backbone for American power and prosperity suddenly feel like an Achilles heel. Disruptive cyber or physical incidents in one system or location, like the Colonial Pipeline or SolarWinds incidents, a major hurricane or geopolitical crisis, or the current PRC campaigns CISA is working to stop, can trigger cascading failures across multiple systems, infrastructure sectors, and regions, magnifying the impact and delaying recovery efforts. When there is no stopping Mother Nature and until we strengthen our defense against malicious cyber infiltrators, expecting disruption and building resilience is a national imperative at all levels of society. Resilience is not optional. In that context, CISA took a strategic approach through national calls-to-action in Stop Passing the Buck on Cybersecurity: Why Companies Must Build Safety Into Tech Products, The Power of Resilience: What America Can Learn from our Partners in Ukraine, and Artificial Intelligence’s Threat to Democracy: How to Safeguard U.S. Elections From AI-Powered Misinformation and Cyberattacks. The implication: critical infrastructure owner/operators, and society as a whole, must anticipate disruption from one or more of the threats in this era as the “new normal” and take preparatory action up front to enhance resilience, operate in a degraded state, and ultimately reduce or eliminate downtime when disruption occurs.  Resilience was elevated as an agency priority and, following the success of the Shields Up campaign, CISA launched the Shields Ready resilience awareness campaign alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to further empower the critical infrastructure community to prepare for, withstand, and recover from potential disruption. Shields Ready promotes four key steps to build resilience that will help individuals and organizations enhance their resilience postures, each aligned to free CISA guidance, tools, and technical assistance available to help achieve their goals. Over the last several years, CISA has doubled down on building resilience at all levels of critical infrastructure and society and will continue to launch and deliver customer-focused products and services that empower critical infrastructure and national resilience in the era of disruption. Other highlights of CISA’s resilience-building efforts since 2021 include:   Resilience-building Guidance, Tools, and AssistanceLaunched our flagship portfolio of resilience resources, centered on the Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework (IRPF) and including the supplemental IRPF Launchpoint and IRPF Playbook guides, as well as the Infrastructure Dependency Primer (IDP), an interactive tool to understand critical infrastructure, dependencies.Released Planning Considerations for Cyber Incidents: Guidance for Emergency Managers, co-developed with FEMA, a first-of-its-kind resource to prepare emergency managers for the disruptive, wide-scale cyber incidents common today.Increased the delivery of free resilience-building assessments by 80% since Shields Ready was launched to help stakeholders understand and mitigate their vulnerabilities.Co-led unprecedented DHS industry engagement on the resilience of critical underseas cables, resulting in the release of Priorities for DHS Engagement on Subsea Cable Security & Resilience.Community-Level Safety and ResilienceLed the DHS efforts to strengthen operational resilience of K-12 schools and school systems against disruptive cyber, physical, and anonymized threats. Launched the Be Air Aware™ program to increase awareness of cyber and physical risks posed by increasingly common unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or drones).  Launched the Operation Flashpoint national awareness campaign with the FBI to help businesses safeguard relevant products that could be used to make homemade bombs.  PartnershipsExpanded civil-military collaboration with the Department of Defense to build resilience in critical infrastructure that enables defense missions.Strengthened resilience-building partnerships with FEMA and the emergency management community, including significant contributions to the first National Resilience Guidance and updated National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) that further integrate critical infrastructure with national preparedness activities. Led the “Critical Five” allied critical infrastructure-focused partnership in 2024 with Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand and implementation of the “Strengthening Integrated Resilience” annual workplan that resulted in the first shared framework for resilience.CISA is committed to expanding and building on this important work, but we can’t do it alone. Business and government entities that own or operate critical infrastructure have a responsibility to enhance resilience because, no matter the line of work or location, critical infrastructure connects us all. In this era of infrastructure disruption, it’s imperative that all critical infrastructure entities work to build resilience by anticipating the potential causes of disruption, understanding vulnerabilities and interdependencies, adopting good cyber hygiene and replacing risky technologies, and developing and exercising incident response plans to sustain operations. It takes adaptation and discipline, but the reward is reduced risk of disruptive downtime and contributing to national resilience, overall. CISA can help.

When there is no stopping Mother Nature and until we strengthen our defense against malicious cyber infiltrators, expecting disruption and building resilience is a national imperative at all levels of society. Resilience is not optional.\nIn that context, CISA took a strategic approach through national calls-to-action in\nStop Passing the Buck on Cybersecurity: Why Companies Must Build Safety Into Tech Products\nThe Power of Resilience: What America Can Learn from our Partners in Ukraine\nArtificial Intelligence’s Threat to Democracy: How to Safeguard U.S. Elections From AI-Powered Misinformation and Cyberattacks\nThe implication: critical infrastructure owner/operators, and society as a whole, must anticipate disruption from one or more of the threats in this era as the “new normal” and take preparatory action\nto enhance resilience, operate in a degraded state, and ultimately reduce or eliminate downtime when disruption occurs.\nwas elevated as an agency priority and, following the success of the\ncampaign, CISA launched the\nresilience awareness campaign\nalongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\nto further empower the critical infrastructure community to prepare for, withstand, and recover from potential disruption. Shields Ready promotes four key steps to build resilience that will help individuals and organizations enhance their resilience postures, each aligned to free CISA guidance, tools, and technical assistance available to help achieve their goals.\nOver the last several years, CISA has doubled down on building resilience at all levels of critical infrastructure and society and will continue to launch and deliver customer-focused products and services that empower critical infrastructure and national resilience in the era of disruption. Other highlights of CISA’s resilience-building efforts since 2021 include:\nResilience-building Guidance, Tools, and Assistance\nLaunched our flagship portfolio of resilience resources, centered on the\nInfrastructure Resilience Planning Framework\nand including the supplemental\nguides, as well as the\nInfrastructure Dependency Primer (IDP)\n, an interactive tool to understand critical infrastructure, dependencies.\nPlanning Considerations for Cyber Incidents: Guidance for Emergency Managers\n, co-developed with FEMA, a first-of-its-kind resource to prepare emergency managers for the disruptive, wide-scale cyber incidents common today.\nIncreased the delivery of\nfree resilience-building assessments\nby 80% since Shields Ready was launched to help stakeholders understand and mitigate their vulnerabilities.\nCo-led unprecedented DHS industry engagement on the resilience of critical underseas cables, resulting in the release of\nPriorities for DHS Engagement on Subsea Cable Security & Resilience\nCommunity-Level Safety and Resilience\nLed the DHS efforts to strengthen operational resilience of K-12 schools and school systems against disruptive cyber, physical, and anonymized threats.\nprogram to increase awareness of cyber and physical risks posed by increasingly common unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or drones).\nnational awareness campaign with the FBI to help businesses safeguard relevant products that\ncould be used to make homemade bombs.\nExpanded civil-military collaboration with the Department of Defense to build resilience in critical infrastructure that enables defense missions.\nStrengthened resilience-building partnerships with FEMA and the emergency management community, including significant contributions to the first\nNational Resilience Guidance\nNational Disaster Recovery Framework\nthat further integrate critical infrastructure with national preparedness activities.\nLed the “Critical Five” allied critical infrastructure-focused partnership in 2024 with Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand and implementation of the “Strengthening Integrated Resilience” annual workplan that resulted in the first shared framework for resilience.\nCISA is committed to expanding and building on this important work, but we can’t do it alone. Business and government entities that own or operate critical infrastructure have a responsibility to enhance resilience because, no matter the line of work or location, critical infrastructure connects us all. In this era of infrastructure disruption, it’s imperative that all critical infrastructure entities work to build resilience by anticipating the potential causes of disruption, understanding vulnerabilities and interdependencies, adopting good cyber hygiene and replacing risky technologies, and developing and exercising incident response plans to sustain operations. It takes adaptation and discipline, but the reward is reduced risk of disruptive downtime and contributing to national resilience, overall. CISA can help.

      "author": "prepositioning cyber threats within critical infrastructure networks, Volt Typhoon was poised to launch destructive cyberattacks of immense proportions against the U.S. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that the malign group compromised critical infrastructure organizations in communications, energy, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems. In a moment of crisis, the PRC could devastate American communities. Through the vigilance, dedication, and hard work of the Threat Hunting team, Volt Typhoon was detected and evicted from many of these critical infrastructure organizations. Despite Volt Typhoon operating in a pattern of behavior inconsistent with traditional cyber espionage, they were no match for our best and brightest. Using their expertise, this unique group of specialists shared Volt Typhoon’s tactics, techniques, and activity with the public, ensuring that the malign group could no longer operate in the dark. Americans owe much to these patriots, though their work often goes unnoticed. This team deserves our deepest gratitude. On behalf of the American people and the United States Congress, I thank the Threat Hunting team for their service to this country.” Notably, a critical element in the U.S. Government’s ability to understand the totality of the Salt Typhoon campaign targeting U.S. telecommunications infrastructure was the fact that CISA threat hunters previously detected the same actors in U.S. government networks. This information, along with industry tippers, is what allowed our law enforcement partners to gain access to images of actor-leased virtual private servers. This, in turn, gave us and our federal government partners visibility into the breadth of the campaign and allowed us to notify and provide technical assistance known or suspected private sector victims.Despite the truly excellent work of our CISA teams and of our federal and industry partners, we know our adversaries remain relentlessly focused on holding our critical infrastructure at risk. And even as we’ve successfully eradicated numerous Chinese intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors, we know that what we have found is likely just the tip of the iceberg. This unrelenting PRC campaign underscores the urgent need for robust cyber defense and vigilance across public and private sectors. CISA’s approach to countering these threats is rooted in partnership and resilience. We remain dedicated to working proactively to reduce further risks from the vulnerable devices that the PRC is using to conduct their intrusions. In doing so, we are leading three lines of effort to address these threats and reduce risks to the American people: First, we are helping victims identify and evict PRC cyber actors from their networks. CISA hunt and incident response teams have deployed to find and eradicate the PRC’s malicious activity across multiple sectors, including energy, transportation, water, and telecommunications. Our regional teams—hundreds of security experts stationed in every state across our nation—are actively working with systemically important entities across sectors that we know have been targeted by PRC activity, helping them strengthen their defenses and reduce their vulnerability.Second, through our Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), we have initiated a cyber defense planning effort with key information technology, communication, and cybersecurity industry partners – as well as USG and international partners – focused on the protection and defense of U.S. critical infrastructure networks from PRC malicious cyber activity. This effort is focused on combining the collective visibility of the internet ecosystem to further understand PRC targeting of critical infrastructure and identifying and implementing mitigations at both the ecosystem and enterprise network levels. Third, we are delivering services across critical infrastructure that directly reduce risks posed by PRC cyber actors, including our CyberSentry threat detection capability; our Attack Surface Management services, now deployed across nearly 7,000 critical infrastructure organizations to identify and mitigate the technology defects that allow these threats to get a foothold in American businesses; and our best-in-class protection capabilities to help prevent successful intrusions against under-resourced businesses. The reality is, however, that rooting out malicious PRC activity and bolstering the security of critical infrastructure organizations are necessary but insufficient. While the PRC is a sophisticated, well-resourced, and formidable cyber adversary, the methods they’re using to exploit our critical infrastructure are not. They don’t have to be—Why? Because in many cases, we’ve made it easy for them. Indeed, the PRC is largely taking advantage of known product defects. The truth is that the technology base upon which our critical infrastructure depends is inherently insecure, because of decades of misaligned incentives that prioritized features and speed to market over security. That must stop. Technology companies must help ensure the PRC and other adversary threat actors cannot exploit defects in technology products to target our critical infrastructure. These weaknesses—and the resulting risks to our national security—can only be addressed at scale by companies building and selling products that are secure by design. We are at a critical juncture for our national security. The clear and present danger from China’s cyber actors must serve as a call to action for the technology and cybersecurity industry, the critical infrastructure community, and all of our partners. Specifically:Every victim of a cyber incident should report it to CISA, every time, recognizing that a threat to one is a threat to many, because cybersecurity is national security. Every critical infrastructure business should establish a relationship with their local CISA team and enroll in our free services, particularly our Vulnerability Scanning program, to help identify and reduce vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited by PRC actors.Every critical infrastructure organization should double down on their commitment to resilience. CEOs, Boards, and every business leader must recognize that they own cyber risk as a business risk and a matter of good governance. They must expect disruption, continually testing the continuity of critical systems and functions to ensure they can operate through disruption and recover rapidly from an attack. Finally, every technology manufacturer and software producer should design, build, test, and deploy their products using the practices outlined in our joint Secure by Design guidance. We must drive toward a future where technology products are safe by design and defective products are not present in critical infrastructure systems. The threats posed by the PRC are real and persistent, and we anticipate they will continue evolving through 2025 and beyond. But these threats are not insurmountable. By fostering a culture of security and resilience and developing IT and software products that are built with security in mind, we can protect our nation’s critical infrastructure. While such deterrence by denial must be accompanied by equally aggressive efforts to hold our adversary’s critical infrastructure at risk—deterrence by punishment—both are equally important to the security and resilience of the critical services Americans depend on every day. At CISA, we know that true success depends on sustained collective action and that the stakes have never been higher. We remain committed—for as long as it takes—to working alongside our partners to address these challenges with the sustained attention and action that they demand. Together, we can outpace our adversaries and achieve a more secure and resilient future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 02, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnder the Digital Radar: Defending Against People’s Republic of China’s Nation-State Cyber Threats to America’s Small Businesses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 01, 2021\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Digital Signatures\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

We help protect and defend the critical services Americans rely on every day against threats from anyone, anywhere, anytime.\nChina’s sophisticated and well-resourced cyber program represents the most serious and significant cyber threat to our nation, and in particular, U.S. critical infrastructure. Last year, I testified about these threats before the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. In my\n, I underscored the very real possibility that a crisis in Asia, precipitated by an invasion of Taiwan or a blockade of the Taiwan Strait, could have very real consequences for the safety and security of American citizens here at home. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pledged on numerous occasions—to include on the eve of Communist China’s 75\nbirthday this past September—to achieve “reunification” with Taiwan, a move analysts assess will likely occur, either peacefully or militarily, by the end of this decade, if not sooner. Such action could be accompanied by disruptive attacks against “everything, everywhere, all at once:” our transportation nodes, our telecommunications services, our power grids, our water facilities, and likely much more—all with the goal of inducing societal panic and deterring our ability to marshal military might and citizen will to expend American blood and treasure in defense of Taiwan.\nOver the past two years, CISA and our federal government and industry partners have been laser focused on deterring\nChina’s cyber aggression\n, working with critical infrastructure entities across the nation to identify and evict Chinese cyber actors, whether they are focused on espionage—such as the recent “Salt Typhoon” campaign against U.S telcos—or disruption—the “Volt Typhoon” campaign designed to disrupt or destroy our most sensitive critical infrastructure.  While PRC cyber actors have attempted to evade detection by using\nliving-off-the-land methods\n—hiding their activity within the native processes of computer operating systems—our world class team of threat hunters have detected them and assisted critical infrastructure partners in evicting them. Their work to address the Volt campaign in particular was recognized in the Congressional Record of June 27, 2024, by Representative Mark E. Green of Tennessee, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He noted:\n“I rise to honor a team of highly skilled cybersecurity professionals for their invaluable service to the United States. While few know their name or see their work, the Threat Hunting team saved millions of Americans from a devastating series of cyberattacks. Volt Typhoon, a malicious state-sponsored cyber actor connected to the People’s Republic of China (PRC), repeatedly targeted critical U.S. infrastructure. By prepositioning cyber threats within critical infrastructure networks, Volt Typhoon was poised to launch destructive cyberattacks of immense proportions against the U.S. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that the malign group compromised critical infrastructure organizations in communications, energy, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems.

      "content": "Securing Federal Networks: Evolving to an Enterprise Approach\nJeff Greene, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn December 2020, organizations across the world were notified that they were victims of a Russian cyberattack. The Russians had compromised the widely used SolarWinds Orion software platform and infected thousands of clients with a corrupted update. A number of\nfederal civilian executive branch\n(FCEB) agencies were among the victims.\nAfter action reviews of the incident revealed the hackers had access to victim networks months before they were detected\nsome of the agencies had seen activity that later proved to be early signs of compromise. Unfortunately, at that time, the U.S. government did not have sufficient visibility or data to correlate seemingly disparate events that had been transpiring across parts of the FCEB for months. Given the nature of the incident—its scope, scale, and the types of networks impacted—things had to change. So, in May of 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14028, directing federal agencies to take dramatic steps to improve their cybersecurity postures. It also empowered CISA, as the operational lead for federal cybersecurity, to drive a much-needed, transformative effort.\nOver the past four years, the federal government has significantly expanded its cybersecurity capabilities, and CISA now has greater visibility into and across FCEB agency networks. This includes the deployment of over 920,000\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR)\nagents across 51 agencies, enabling analysts to hunt actively for intrusions and evict adversaries before they are able to cause harm. Further, through CISA’s EDR Persistent Access Capability (PAC), we can conduct no-notice, proactive hunts with zero operational impacts to FCEB networks. Put simply, we are now operating as a ‘whole of government’ threat hunting organization.\nThrough this effort, we can also access both public and classified indicators of compromise (IOCs), which has allowed us to provide better and more proactive threat notifications to federal agencies. Ultimately, the EDR advancements allow CISA and FCEB agencies to move from a fragmented approach to an enterprise strategy, enabling us to rapidly determine risk across the federal enterprise and thus reduce the impact and dwell time of malicious activity.\nThese efforts are further enhanced by advances in our\nContinuous Diagnostics and Mitigation\nprogram. CDM enables unprecedented levels of visibility into FCEB networks, including the types of hardware and software that are running on different networks. The system now collects and centralizes information from the FCEB networks, feeding data into the CDM dashboard, which allows individual FCEB agencies and CISA to share a common operating picture.\nTo further assist FCEB agencies, we established the\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities\nwhich helps organizations prioritize how they manage vulnerabilities based on those being actively exploited by threat actors. Since FY21, FCEB agencies have remediated an incredible\nof internet facing KEVs identified by CISA.\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\nthat helps agencies streamline day-to-day operations when disclosing and managing cyber vulnerabilities by serving as the primary point of entry for receiving, triaging, and routing vulnerabilities disclosed by public researchers. In FY24 alone, CISA received over 4,000 unique researcher submissions.\nHardening Systems & Providing Guidance\nBeyond enhanced visibility, CISA also works with FCEB agencies to enhance their security efforts. Our\nProtective DNS Service\nfor instance, prevents government internet traffic from reaching known malicious destinations by using state-of-the-art DNS technologies in combination with CISA’s proprietary and commercial threat intelligence. Since the program started in 2021, Protective DNS has blocked more than 1.86 billion malicious connections.\nAdditionally, at the beginning of FY24, we launched an all-new infrastructure for the\n.gov top-level domain\nThe goal was to both improve the security for those using that domain and encourage more entities to start using it. As of December 2024, there are over 10,000 non-federal .gov domains and 1,474 federal .gov domains.\nWe also continue to use our operational directives to focus FCEB agencies on addressing the most serious security gaps. As the most recent example, we issued\nBinding Operational Directive 25-01\nin December, requiring FCEB agencies to identify specific cloud tenants, implement assessment tools, and align cloud environments to meet CISA’s\nSecure Cloud Business Applications\nconfiguration baselines.\nFinally, we continue to assist FCEB agencies as they migrate to\n(ZT) architecture. Recent attacks against mobile broadband providers’ infrastructure are a reminder that all aspects of mobile infrastructure are susceptible to malicious activity; indeed, none can be assumed to be inherently trustworthy. We established the Zero Trust Initiative (ZTI) to help agencies prioritize the programs, tools, and capabilities they should consider during their ZT journeys.\nIn September 2024, we released the\nFCEB Operational Cybersecurity Alignment\n(FOCAL) Plan. Developed in collaboration with FCEB agencies, the plan provides guidance on standard, essential components of enterprise operational cybersecurity and outlines how we can align collective operational defense capabilities across the federal enterprise.\nFCEB security will always be a work in progress – because our adversaries are always changing their tactics. The FOCAL plan demonstrates some targeted areas of improvement where we, as a federal government, can expand and enhance our security in the coming years. While we can expect that sophisticated adversaries will continue to evolve their techniques in attempts to evade detection and inflict more harm, our FCEB partners are now better positioned to take on these challenges. CISA stands ready to continue providing critical support to protect the critical infrastructure of the dot.gov.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration",

      "content": "Building a Secure by Design Ecosystem\nJen Easterly, Director\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nThroughout my career, I’ve observed that making software safer isn’t easy or cheap, yet it is the only way to truly protect our systems. It’s similar to improving car safety in the 1960s: building better designs—like those with seatbelts, crumple zones, and reinforced frames—proved far more effective at saving lives than responding to accidents after they occurred. But these advances didn’t happen overnight. They required sustained investment, coordination, and vigilance. During my time in the Army, the Intelligence Community, and at Morgan Stanley, we dedicated significant resources to securing the software we developed. Even with these resources, the work was never easy, cheap, or perfect. However, the payoff was undeniable: safer systems, stronger outcomes, and fewer preventable failures.\nThe Secure by Design movement has ignited tangible improvements in how manufacturers develop and secure software. What SbD has accomplished so far:\nSecure by Design Pledge.\nIn May 2024, CISA launched the voluntary SbD pledge, calling on manufacturers to commit to seven foundational security goals. At its inception, 68 companies took this pledge. Today, more than 250 companies have joined the movement, marking a significant shift toward making secure design a standard practice.\nIndustry SbD Leadership.\nLarge players in the tech industry have embraced SbD principles, not just in name but in action. Google, for instance, has implemented\ninitiatives directly aligned with the pledge\n, demonstrating a commitment to embedding security at every stage of development. Similarly,\nMicrosoft’s Secure Future Initiative\nhas become a beacon of proactive security, with a progress report highlighting their focus on secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations to better safeguard customers. These efforts underscore the power of industry leadership in driving systemic change.\nIn April of 2023, CISA launched the\n(SbD) movement with our whitepaper,\nShifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk\n. This effort is akin to the transformative movement sparked by Ralph Nader’s 1965 book\n, which exposed the “built-in dangers” of car design and spurred manufacturers on to prioritize safety. Just as that movement led to safer vehicles, Secure by Design aims to address the “built-in dangers” of insecure software.\nIn the mid-20th century, we faced a crisis on the roads: Poorly designed cars contributed to accidents that caused catastrophic injuries and deaths. It wasn’t until we, as a nation, learned that these accidents weren’t just inevitable “user errors” but a result of unsafe design that things began to change. After learning this, we pushed manufacturers to adopt new features like seat belts, airbags, and anti-lock brakes—solutions that saved countless lives.\n” era of software. Just as unsafe car design once led to fatal crashes, we currently accept dangerous software, and the commonly resulting system comprise, as inevitable. We’ve been misled into blaming users for poor security habits—failing to apply updates, for example—rather than asking whether design flaws could be the issue.\nIn 2007, MITRE identified\n13 \"unforgivable\" software defects\n—akin to faulty brakes or missing seat belts. These defects are preventable, yet a whopping 10 of them are listed in MITRE's recently published\n2024 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses\n. Coding errors like memory-unsafe code and SQL injection – which we and the FBI\nhave deemed bad practices\n– remain widespread and easy for malicious actors to exploit.\nThe consequences are predictable, and we see them in the headlines. Foreign adversaries, particularly those associated with the People’s Republic of China, routinely exploit software vulnerabilities in network edge devices to infiltrate our systems. The damage is expensive, time-consuming, and reputationally catastrophic. Worse, the deep integration of private companies, utilities, and critical infrastructure has turned these compromises into a national security crisis—one we likely don’t yet fully comprehend.\nSoftware won’t get safer until we demand it.\nThe truth is: We don’t have a cybersecurity problem; we have a software quality problem. We are now at a tipping point—with foreign adversaries rampantly exploiting defective software—where this recognition is leading to a concerted\nfor better security. Just as automobile safety reforms only succeeded when the public demanded safer cars as a basic standard, the software industry will only prioritize secure design when we, as a nation, demand it as the baseline for a functioning, secure, digital ecosystem.\nThe Secure by Design initiative supports this demand by equipping customers with key questions to ask vendors about their software—just as public safety campaigns taught the nation how to evaluate the safety features of their cars. By empowering users, we aim to create a seismic shift in software security.\nDriving demand is essential, but achieving lasting change requires fostering accountability and industry-wide adoption of SbD principles—from the CEO’s office to the developer’s desk. In May 2024, we launched CISA’s\nSecure by Design pledge\n, where now over 250 companies have committed to driving measurable progress towards seven key SbD goals. Since then, we’ve seen more and more companies\nreport on the good progress\nthey’re making. Expanding the number of companies signing the SbD pledge is key.

As a relatively new agency, these national policy activities have shaped and molded who we are as an agency, our role in the interagency, and our biggest priorities. As we begin to look forward to 2025 and beyond, we wanted to highlight some of the most influential policy efforts in recent years. 2021In the wake of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, Executive Order (EO) 14028, \"Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity\" was issued in May, tasking CISA with a variety of actions to strengthen the security of federal government networks, including removing barriers to threat information sharing, modernizing and implementing stronger cybersecurity standards for the federal government, and improving software supply chain security. Later in the year, the administration issued the National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, which directed CISA to develop a series of Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to meaningfully reduce risks to both critical infrastructure operations and the American people. These CPGs are a subset of cybersecurity practices, selected through a thorough process of industry, government, and expert consultation, aimed to help small- and medium-sized organizations kickstart their cybersecurity efforts by prioritizing investment in a limited number of essential actions with high-impact security outcomes.2022In March 2022, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) was signed into law, requiring covered critical infrastructure entities to report covered cyber incidents and ransom payments to CISA within 24 hours after a payment is made. These reports will allow CISA to rapidly deploy resources and render assistance to victims suffering attacks, analyze incoming reporting across sectors to spot trends, and quickly share that information with network defenders to warn other potential victims – better arming CISA to achieve its mission as the nation’s cyber defense agency. CIRCIA also established two additional efforts: the Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF) and the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) program. The JRTF serves as the central body for coordinating an ongoing nationwide campaign against ransomware attacks in addition to identifying and pursuing opportunities for international cooperation. co-chaired by CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the JRTF coordinates existing interagency ransomware efforts and works to identify new initiatives to effectively leverage the unique authorities and capabilities across the U.S. government and the private sector to address ransomware threats.Through the RVWP, CISA has identified vulnerabilities commonly associated with known ransomware exploitation and warned critical infrastructure entities whose networks or devices may be susceptible to those vulnerabilities, enabling mitigation before a ransomware incident occurs. The RVWP completed 1,754 notifications in 2023 to entities operating an internet-accessible vulnerable device. Following notification of the vulnerabilities, CISA regularly conducted vulnerability scans to determine whether the entities appear to have mitigated their vulnerable devices. Our findings indicated that 852 of the 1,754 notifications (49%) of vulnerable devices were either patched, implemented a compensating control, or taken offline after notification from CISA. 2023 The 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) laid out the national approach to increasing the ecosystem’s cybersecurity. It detailed a comprehensive list of actions for CISA to take alongside our federal partners and allies, including updating the National Cyber Incident Response Plan, countering ransomware efforts through the JRTF, and enhancing operational collaboration efforts with industry partners. These actions were outlined in more detail in the National Cyber Strategy Implementation Plan, which provided a roadmap for the implementation of the NCS. 2024Most recently, on April 30, 2024, the National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22) further codified CISA’s statutory role as the National Coordinator for the Security and Resilience of U.S. Critical Infrastructure, empowering us to implement a new risk management cycle that prioritizes collaborating with partners to identify and mitigate sector, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk. This cycle, which will be refreshed biennially, enables systematic risk reduction efforts that the U.S. government will take in collaboration with relevant partners. The culmination of this cycle is the creation of the 2025 National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan, which will guide federal efforts to secure and protect critical infrastructure over the coming years. These efforts will be critical to help USG to better understand sector and cross sector risk and more efficiently prioritize risk reduction efforts going forward. CISA’s role has evolved and will continue to evolve to reflect the threat landscape and policy ecosystem that the United States operates in. We look forward to continued partnership with our federal, SLTT, and private sector partners to better secure our world.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 07, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nTarget Rich, Cyber Poor: Strengthening Our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 19, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nFrom Naturalization to Cyber Advocacy: CISA Region 3’s Chris Ramos Inspires New U.S. Citizens\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 02, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnder the Digital Radar: Defending Against People’s Republic of China’s Nation-State Cyber Threats to America’s Small Businesses\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

More recently, however, corporate leaders have begun to see cyber risk for what it is: a strategic, enterprise risk, which they—not their Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)—own. Today, given our complex, dynamic, and highly interconnected environment—an environment where nation state adversaries are more active and capable than ever, and where the private sector is on the front lines of the cyber fight—boards and company leadership must consider the critical role they play in national security and ensuring systemic resilience.To help advance this effort, CISA partnered with the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) and the Internet Security Alliance to develop the NACD Director's Handbook on Cyber-Risk Oversight, laying out a framework for considering cyber risk as a function of board governance. As noted in the Handbook’s foreword, we need a new model of sustainable cybersecurity—one that starts with a commitment at the board level to incentivize a culture in which managing cyber risk is treated as a fundamental matter of good governance. Indeed, Board members have unique power to drive such a culture through their actions and decisions:They should ensure that CISOs are fully empowered, with the influence and resources necessary to drive decisions where cybersecurity is effectively prioritized. Decisions to prioritize cost, features, or speed to market over security must be made transparently, with clear ownership by the Chief Executive Officer and Board and visibility by potentially impacted customers. Cybersecurity, as a matter of safety, should not be allowed to significantly lag behind innovation. They should ensure that their peers and the senior executives that they oversee are well-educated on cyber risk, that cybersecurity considerations are appropriately prioritized in every business, technology, and software acquisition decision, and that decisions to accept rather than mitigate cyber risks are scrutinized and revisited often. Relatedly, boards should carefully consider which committee oversees cyber risk: while cyber risk has traditionally been the purview of the audit committee and treated largely as a matter of compliance, a small number of boards are establishing cybersecurity or technology risk committees to more effectively manage cyber risk. They should review their company’s cyber-risk management framework and ensure the development of a common set of standards which the organization can use to determine and measure their exposure to cybersecurity risk. They should ensure that the thresholds for reporting potential malicious activity to senior management are not set too high; rather, they should be briefed on “near misses” as well as those intrusion attempts that succeed, as such near misses are among the most important signals to assess the quality of a company’s defenses and its reaction to incidents.Finally, board members should actively champion a model of collaboration over self-preservation—one where information about malicious activity is shared proactively with expectations that the government will be responsive and add value, and that industry will not suffer punitive sanction for sharing. As the nation’s cyber defense agency, CISA’s goal is to advance a new model of sustainable cybersecurity by working collaboratively with our partners to drive down risk to our nation, enabling the broader safety of consumers. The time is now for CEOs and Boards to actively embrace corporate cyber responsibility as a matter of good governance, recognizing that every organization has an obligation to reasonably assure the safety of their employees, partners, and customers.  This movement can start by ensuring that CEOs and Board Members are held personally accountable for effectively managing cyber risk and directly engaged when it comes to corporate cybersecurity decisions and the cybersecurity of their companies.  As NACD notes, security isn’t an IT function, but rather a culture and set of repeatable practices driven by the CEO and senior executives to reduce risk, wherein cyber literacy is considered like financial literacy: “Not everyone on the board is an auditor, but everyone should be able to read a financial statement and understand the financial language of business.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

In today’s environment, however, kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools face an evolving and dynamic set of security threats, ranging from acts of targeted violence to cyber incidents. CISA’s mission is to lead the national effort to understand, manage and reduce risks to the cyber and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every day. As part of this role, we established the School Safety Task Force (SSTF) to help strengthen the safety and security of K-12 schools across the country. Since its inception, the SSTF has worked closely with the broader school safety community to understand and address the unique needs of and challenges faced by the K-12 community. The program’s work centers around developing and deploying tailored and actionable resources, raising awareness about new and emerging threats and hazards, and coordinating federal government efforts to help schools and school districts create and maintain safe and supportive learning environments. One of the program’s key initiatives was the establishment of the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse). The Clearinghouse is an interagency effort among the U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Justice, that was created in the wake of the 2018 tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. The Clearinghouse’s public website, SchoolSafety.gov, serves as a one-stop access point for more than 750 resources, guidance and evidence-based practices on a range of school safety topics. The site also includes several tools to help members of the K-12 community prioritize school safety actions, find applicable resources and funding opportunities, connect with state and local school safety officials, and develop school safety plans. To further enhance the these efforts, the Department of Homeland Security established the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse External Advisory Board in 2024 to provide advice and recommendations on practical ways to enhance K-12 school safety and security. SSTF’s work is driven by the larger school safety community and its specific needs. To that end, we’ve developed several capacity-building products tailored for school communities. These include the K-12 Bystander Reporting Toolkit, which offers strategies for how schools can encourage bystander reporting among students and members of the school community, and the K-12 Anonymized Threat Response Guidance to help schools and their law enforcement and community partners create tailored approaches to addressing anonymous threats of violence. These types of products support K-12 communities in strengthening their prevention, protection and mitigation capabilities against some of the most pressing and prevalent threats. But it is not sufficient to just make resources available to the community. Ensuring the safety and security of schools is an imperative mission, and it requires continuous outreach, training and engagement. We aim to educate and equip K-12 communities with information on current and emerging threats through regular communications via social media channels, newsletters and publication of issue briefs on key school safety topics. In addition, we work directly with K-12 stakeholders through our field force across the country, participating in hundreds of local-, state-, and national-level conferences, and conducting trainings designed to address key school safety issues. We also annually convene the National Summit on K-12 School Safety and Security, welcoming thousands of school safety stakeholders from across the country to share information on the most critical and timely safety issues and explore research-informed strategies for addressing security challenges and risks.K-12 communities have made tremendous progress to enhance school safety, but we cannot afford to be complacent. As threats and challenges continue to evolve, CISA stands ready to support our country’s schools, districts, federal, state, local, tribal and territorial partners in addressing their unique needs and ultimately creating safer learning environments for students and teachers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 14, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nReflecting on the Parkland tragedy, its lasting impacts, and work still to be done\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nFindings and Updates from CISA’s Ongoing Collaboration with Education Technology Vendors to Address K-12 Cybersecurity Challenges \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 30, 2023\n\nBlog\n\n\n\n CISA Resources to Help Schools Strengthen Security and Build Resilience\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nAug 29, 2022\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nBack to School Safety: Resources to Support Our Nation’s Students and Schools\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

Cyber Civil Defense seeks to advance citizen cyber education, foster innovation in cyber tools, and build a unique cybersecurity workforce. By leveraging resources, thinking creatively, and promoting basic cybersecurity practices, we can better protect the nation from cyber actors who threaten our way of life. No single entity can secure the nation alone; it requires a unified effort. At CISA, we are committed to empowering communities to take an active role in safeguarding our shared digital future. As a key part of this work, we launched Secure Our World in 2023, our first-ever public awareness program, along with key partners across industry and the non-profit world, to help educate everyone about how they can be a part of our nation’s cyber defense in their ever day lives and in their organizations. The Secure Our World campaign centers around four simple steps to improve cyber hygiene: 1) Use Strong Passwords and a Password Manager; 2) Turn On Multifactor Authentication; 3) Recognize and Report Phishing, and 4) Update Software. It features extensive easy-to-use resources, including tipsheets and how-to guides, as well as a series of animated videos. Beyond Secure Our World, we’ve also championed the “Cyber Clinics” model as a promising, scalable solution for enhancing the cyber resilience of small organizations at the local level through the expertise of students studying to be the next generation of cyber defenders. Similar to free legal clinics which are staffed by law students, these cyber clinics help provide cybersecurity students hands-on experience by supporting their local communities with cyber support and guidance. In support of these efforts, we published a new guide in February 2024 highlighting CISA support available to cybersecurity clinics and their clients. It provides information related to informational briefings and partnerships, tools and services, and available grants. Our goal is to ensure that our partners have the right tools and resources to better protect and secure their respective communities. In addition to this work, as part of our High-Risk Communities Protection effort, we launched a resource webpage which includes a cyber volunteer portal that highlights several cybersecurity clinics across the country. The goal is to connect expert volunteers with organizations that would benefit from receiving these services. CISA also published a comprehensive cybersecurity toolkit to help high-risk organizations assess their cybersecurity posture and take actionable steps to enhance it. Finally, we launched Project Upskill, a program designed to empower vulnerable populations with straightforward guidance to strengthen their cybersecurity. Over the past year, we’ve taken this initiative nationwide, supporting regional events across the country to provide tailored support and deliver this critical guidance directly to at-risk communities.In a world increasingly reliant on technology, each of us plays a vital role in strengthening cyber resilience.

Over the last several years, we’ve witnessed increasingly frequent and complex attacks against small and medium sized businesses, K-12 schools, water utilities, and healthcare organizations, including hospitals, which were in the past considered “off-limits.”\nMany small and medium sized organizations, think that they’re too small to be targeted by cyber criminals. This is simply not true. In reality, small and medium sized businesses have valuable information that cyber criminals seek and often have fewer resources dedicated to cybersecurity. To counter our adversaries, CISA has been focused on supporting small businesses by sharing key cybersecurity and physical resources and tips—many of which can be found on our\nSmall and Medium Businesses webpage\n–so small businesses can protect their networks, operations, data, and employees.\nCISA provides a list of\nfree cybersecurity tools and services\nprovided by private and public sector organizations across the cyber community targeted at small and medium sized organizations.\nto serve as a one-stop-shop of free resources for organizations of any size to protect themselves from becoming victims of ransomware.\nPower of Hello resources\ncan help business owners and their employees identify and effectively respond to suspicious behavior.\nSmall businesses aren’t our adversaries’ only focus—our nation’s critical infrastructure is a priority target as well. Despite efforts by sectors including\nWater and Wastewater Systems\nthe Education Services and Facilities Subsector (K-12 Community)\nHealthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector\nto invest in additional resources for cybersecurity, they remain at elevated risk from adversaries who see them as highly profitable targets, generally “target-rich, cyber-poor.” Over the past two years, CISA has been working closely with industry partners in these sectors, along with their Sector Risk Management Agencies—Environmental Protection Agency for water, Department of Education for K-12, and the Department of Health and Human Services for hospitals—to help them understand the threats they face and increase their cyber defenses and resilience.\nThese partnership engagements include providing risk assessments and risk mitigation guidance; coordinating cross-sector mitigation planning; sharing information and tools to strengthen the security of critical infrastructure; and conducting exercises and simulations of cybersecurity and all hazard incidents to build preparedness and resilience.\nIn 2023, these efforts involved nearly 6,700 stakeholder engagements with public and private sector participants, including almost 2,700 engagements with the healthcare community; more than 1,700 with the water sector; and more than 2,200 with the K-12 community. We ramped up this work in 2024, completing over 9,400 engagements, including 3,900 with healthcare, 3,400 with water entities, and more than 2,000 with schools.\nWe also published several key products focused on these sectors, bringing together existing resources to ensure easy access. These include:\nCybersecurity for K-12 Education webpage\nProtecting Our Future: Partnering to Safeguard K-12 Organizations from Cybersecurity Threats\nHealthcare and Public Health Cybersecurity webpage\nJoint Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector Cybersecurity Toolkit\nwith HHS and the HPH Sector Coordinating Council\nHPH Sector CISA Tabletop Exercise Package (CTEP)\nWater and Wastewater Cybersecurity webpage\nWater/Wastewater Systems CTEP\nJoint cyber hygiene fact sheet for water\nInternet-Exposed HMIs Pose Cybersecurity Risks to Water and Wastewater Systems | CISA\nIn addition to these no-cost resources, we manage grant programs to help our State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) partners build cybersecurity capacity. The\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021\nestablished the first-of-its-kind\nState and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program\nto support SLTT governments across the country and appropriated $1 billion for this program. The program enables access to funding to address cyber threats and vulnerabilities, identify and evaluate needed capabilities, implement measures to mitigate the threats, and develop a modern cyber workforce across local communities. We support these efforts with a suite of available resources, including\nstate cybersecurity coordinators and cybersecurity advisors\nlocated in communities across the nation.\nWhile these programs are making an impact in communities across the nation to reduce the risk of cyber threats, more remains to be done to protect our most vulnerable and essential sectors from nation state and criminal threats. This requires the participation and support of all organizations, large and small, urban and rural. As I’ve said for years, everybody has a role to play in cybersecurity and we need everybody to play their role. If you haven’t already, please check out all of the free resources available to you and engage with your local CISA partners located in your towns and cities. With support from our public and private sector partners, Congress, and our teammates located throughout the country, CISA is here to help.\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nCISA Through the Years: Policy and Impact\nFrom Naturalization to Cyber Advocacy: CISA Region 3’s Chris Ramos Inspires New U.S. Citizens\nUnder the Digital Radar: Defending Against People’s Republic of China’s Nation-State Cyber Threats to America’s Small Businesses",

      "content": "Key Cyber Initiatives from CISA: KEV Catalog, CPGs, and PRNI\nJeff Greene, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn an era of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, securing critical infrastructure has become a cornerstone of national security. CISA’s mission is to drive collaborative, proactive efforts to reduce risk and strengthen resilience for our nation’s critical infrastructure, federal civilian branch assets, and the private sector more broadly. While these efforts are many and varied, I’d like to highlight three particularly transformative initiatives—the\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities\nCybersecurity Performance Goals\nPre-Ransomware Notification Initiative\n(PRNI)—to illustrate how we can collectively work to reshape the cybersecurity landscape.\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog\nIn November 2021, CISA introduced the KEV Catalog to address a critical challenge: the growing backlog of unpatched vulnerabilities being actively exploited by threat actors. Amid rising concerns about the risk to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) networks, CISA established the KEV Catalog to help prioritize efforts to remediate software vulnerabilities based on whether such vulnerabilities are being actively exploited by threat actors. While a requirement to remediate KEV Catalog-listed vulnerabilities is only binding on FCEB agencies, the KEV Catalog was immediately a useful resource for all organizations, including non-federal organizations large and small.\nComprehensive Repository:\nThe KEV Catalog now includes over 1,200 vulnerabilities, representing a robust and growing knowledge base.\nmandates FCEB agencies to remediate KEV-listed vulnerabilities within strict timeframes, creating a cascading effect that has influenced private sector practices to proactively pursue remediation.\nAccelerated Remediation:\nOrganizations address KEV vulnerabilities 3.5 times faster than non-KEV vulnerabilities. FCEB agencies alone have remediated over 12 million KEV findings between 2022 and 2023.\nSLTT (State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial) governments using CISA’s free vulnerability scanning services saw a 31% reduction in KEVs exposed on their networks for periods longer than 45 days.\nGlobal Collaboration:\nThe KEV Catalog’s public and accessible nature has encouraged adoption among international partners, enhancing collective resilience.\nCybersecurity Performance Goals\nIntroduced in October 2022, CISA established the Cybersecurity Performance Goals to translate broad guidance into specific, actionable, and measurable practices. Designed in partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and intended to serve as a simplified extract of NIST’s comprehensive Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), the CPGs aim to provide practical benchmarks tailored to critical infrastructure sectors. The initiative acknowledges the resource constraints faced by many organizations, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, many of which form elements of the complex supply chains relied upon by critical infrastructure entities.\nCross-Sector Guidance:\nThe initial release of CPGs provided a baseline framework applicable across the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, focusing on achievable outcomes.\nSector-Specific Evolution:\nIn January 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) introduced healthcare-specific CPGs, followed by tailored guidance for the Chemical, Energy, and Information Technology sectors usually in coordination with each sector’s own Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA). Other sectors are working on their own specific CPGs as well.\nRecognizing unique challenges, the CPGs include simplified recommendations for smaller organizations to enhance their cybersecurity without overwhelming resources.\nStakeholder Feedback Integration:\nCISA released updated CPGs in March 2023, incorporating industry insights to refine and expand their applicability.\nThrough partnerships with industry associations, regulatory bodies, and compliance frameworks, CISA has promoted the CPGs as a critical component of third-party risk assessments and best practices.\nPre-Ransomware Notification Initiative\nRansomware attacks have had devastating repercussions for businesses large and small around the country and the world. In response, CISA launched the PRNI in March 2023 to enable a shift from reactive to proactive defense, partnering with researchers around the globe to provide early warning to organizations to help them disrupt ransomware campaigns in their nascent stages, likely saving them hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in recovery costs.\nPRNI has issued over 3,300 notifications since its inception, with over 2,100 alerts conducted in 2024 alone.\nHundreds of notifications have been sent to high-risk sectors, including K-12 schools, hospitals, and SLTT entities, helping them avoid encryption and data loss.\nEarly alerts prevented ransomware encryption in at least 154 healthcare organizations in 2023, safeguarding critical patient data and saving millions in potential costs.\nPRNI’s efficient notification system ensures timely communication, allowing organizations to take swift action.\nCollaboration with international partners has extended PRNI’s benefits to allied nations, strengthening collective defenses against ransomware.\nBroader Impact and the Path Forward\nThe KEV Catalog, CPGs, and PRNI exemplify CISA’s commitment to fostering collaboration across public and private sectors. These initiatives have helped to reshape cybersecurity by prioritizing proactive defense, measurable outcomes, and resource-efficient solutions. They play a significant role in our nation’s cyber defense and their influence will continue to grow:\nEnhanced Public-Private Partnerships:\nCISA’s emphasis on shared responsibility has galvanized critical infrastructure stakeholders to take action, and resources like the KEV Catalog, CPGs, and PRNI make engagement easier and improved resilience more accessible.\nQuantifiable Risk Reduction:\nTangible results via metrics such as faster patch times for KEVs and disruptions of ransomware campaigns demonstrate the impact of strong cyber resilience and encourage slower adopters to elevate their cybersecurity efforts.\nBy sharing best practices and fostering international cooperation, CISA is developing a robust, active cyber community basted on partnership and information sharing, which will elevate everyone’s cyber resilience.\nWhile challenges persist and new threats will always emerge, the successes of the KEV Catalog, CPGs, and PRNI underscore the importance of proactive, collaborative approaches to cybersecurity. Looking ahead, these initiatives can serve as a blueprint for navigating the complex and interconnected digital landscape of the future.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

The\nIT Sector Specific Goals (SSGs)\nare aligned to Secure by Design principles and will help to protect the sector from cyber incidents, identify and address vulnerabilities prior to product release, improve incident response, and significantly improve software security. CISA worked extensively with the IT Sector Coordinating Council (IT SCC) to develop these goals. Through the IT SCC, subject matter experts, associations, and other key partners provided critical, beneficial input and supported the development process.\nWhile specific to the IT sector, the goals provide software and product developers in all\ncritical infrastructure sectors\nwith minimum foundational practices upon which they should focus their efforts. Recommended actions include:\nLogically separate all software development environments from each other using controls such as network segmentation and access controls.\nRegularly log, monitor, and review trust relationships used for authorization and access across software development environments.\nRequire multi-factor authentication (MFA)—ideally phishing resistant MFA—to access all software development environments.\nEstablish and enforce security requirements for software products used across software development environments.\nDo not store sensitive data or credentials in source code. Instead, store sensitive data and credentials in an encrypted manner, such as using a secret manager.\nEstablish a software supply chain risk management program\n“The IT SSGs help critical infrastructure sectors significantly strengthen cybersecurity in the design and development of software and hardware. We encourage organizations to review and implement the goals which will benefit and protect the supply chain including consumers,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n, “The industry collaboration was critical to shaping goals with highest-impact and guiding organizations to prioritize their efforts. We applaud organizations that are choosing to take ownership of the security outcomes of their customers.”\nCISA encourages product developers to adopt these SSGs to significantly improve the cybersecurity posture of software products, to include those designed for critical infrastructure services, relied upon by our nation.

This guide is for federal grant program managers, critical infrastructure owners and operators and organizations such as state, local, tribal, and territorial governments who subaward grant program funds, and grant program recipients.\nGiven the importance of securing the Nation’s critical infrastructure, the Government has made a historic investment through the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act. The United States has a unique opportunity and national security imperative to build cyber resilience into this next generation of American infrastructure.\nPlaybook for Strengthening Cybersecurity in Federal Grant Programs for Critical Infrastructure\n, helps all grant-making agencies to incorporate cybersecurity requirements into their respective grant programs. It provides tools and resources the grant program can direct applicants towards to support their ability to meet the requirements. Specifically, this guidance contains:\nRecommended actions to incorporate cybersecurity into grant programs throughout the grant management lifecycle.\nModel language for grant program managers and sub-awarding organizations to incorporate into Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) and Terms & Conditions.\nTemplates for recipients to leverage when developing a Cyber Risk Assessment and Project Cybersecurity Plan.\nComprehensive list of cybersecurity resources available to support grant recipient project execution.\n“We are excited to provide this guidance to grant-making organizations, along with our teammates at the Office of the National Cyber Director,” said\nJen Easterly, CISA Director\n. “As organizations seek to take advantage of historic infrastructure grants, it’s critical to ensure the security and resilience of this next generation of American infrastructure in every community across our nation.”\n\"ONCD, along with our partners at CISA, continues to advocate for cybersecurity to be incorporated into the foundation and design of the Nation's critical infrastructure,” said\nHarry Coker Jr., White House National Cyber Director.\n“As we make investments in rebuilding and updating our infrastructure through funding such as made available from the Investing in America agenda, we have the opportunity and obligation to build in cybersecurity by design. We need infrastructure projects to be shovel ready and cyber ready. That’s why we’re proud that the guidance released today will serve as a helpful resource to help our partners and recipients build cybersecurity into infrastructure projects from the beginning.\"\nCISA and ONCD developed this playbook to be a minimal burden on the federal grant awarding process.

It’s been a great honor to lead CISA the past three and a half years. I’d like to thank our incredible staff as well as our government, private sector, and international partners for helping us build resilience, reduce risk, and make our country more secure.”\nThroughout the year, CISA focused on leading the national effort to reduce risk to the cyber and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every day and working collaboratively to win and maintain the trust of the agency’s many partners across industry, state and local officials, and the election stakeholder community.\nJust a few of CISA’s efforts over the year include:\nProtecting Election Infrastructure against Security Risks\n. This year, thanks to the tireless efforts of the nation’s state and local election officials, our\nwere secure and resilient. Since the election infrastructure subsector was designated essential in 2017, CISA has worked extensively with election officials, election technology and service providers, and federal partners across the nation to offer threat briefings and voluntary risk mitigation guidance to support the election infrastructure community’s efforts to manage risks to their systems and infrastructure. This continued work across all levels of government resulted in election infrastructure that has helped increase election security and resilience and strengthen the election community’s ability to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people and a peaceful transfer of power.\nMitigating Nation-State Threats\n. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors—particularly those backed by the governments of\nChina, Russia, North Korea, and Iran\n—are well-resourced and engage in sophisticated malicious cyber activity that is targeted and aimed at prolonged network and system intrusion. Over the past year, CISA continued to focus on detecting, preventing and mitigating these threats; advanced scalable vulnerability reduction for government and critical infrastructure; and increased awareness, preparedness, and resilience focused on threats and tactics.\nRaising Awareness of Secure by Design Principles\n. This year, CISA made meaningful progress to ensure safer and more secure technology products for everyone.

Through the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) and in close coordination with the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), this update addresses significant changes in policy and cyber operations since NCIRP was released in 2016.\nThe NCIRP is the nation’s strategic framework for coordinated response to cyber incidents along four lines of effort: Asset Response, Threat Response, Intelligence Support, and Affected Entity Response. It includes coordination mechanisms, key decision points, and priority activities across the cyber incident response lifecycle. The NCIRP also identifies structures that response stakeholders should leverage to coordinate cyber incidents requiring cross-sector, public-private, or federal coordination; however, it is not meant to be a step-by-step instruction manual.\nCISA collaborated extensively with government and industry partners to provide an agile, actionable updated framework that ensures coherent coordination to match the pace of our adversaries.  Key updates in this draft include:\nA defined path for non-federal stakeholders to participate in coordination of cyber incident response;\nImproved usability by streamlining content and aligning to an operational lifecycle;\nRelevant legal and policy changes impacting agency roles and responsibilities; and\nA predictable cycle for future updates of the NCIRP.\n“Today’s increasingly complex threat environment demands that we have a seamless, agile, and effective incident response framework,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “This draft NCIRP Update leverages the lessons learned over the past several years to achieve a deeper unity of effort between the government and the private sector.

CISA invites stakeholders from across public and private sectors to share their perspective, inform our findings, and contribute to this revision. On the\n, public comments will be accepted until January 15, 2025.\nWorking towards our goal to provide an agile, actionable framework to ensure coherent coordination that matches the pace of our adversaries, this draft includes key updates:\nA defined path for non-federal stakeholders to participate in coordination of cyber incident response;\nImproved usability by streamlining content and aligning to an operational lifecycle;\nRelevant legal and policy changes impacting agency roles and responsibilities; and\nA predictable cycle for future updates of the NCIRP.\nIn October 2023, CISA\nits collaborative effort to update the NCIRP, as directed by the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy. The goal is to ensure that the 2024 update process captures the significant evolution of the cybersecurity landscape since 2016. Additionally, CISA wanted to ensure it includes fresh perspectives and sets out an updated approach for addressing real-world national incident response and collaboration.\nEngagement – Information Exchange\nSince CISA launched the effort last fall, the core planning team has brought together more than 150 experts from 66 distinct organizations across the cybersecurity community, including Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) participants, to represent the broad critical infrastructure community. The core planning team, which includes representation from federal, state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government partners; private sector owners and operators; and sector coordinating councils have held ten working sessions. These sessions addressed themes including roles and responsibilities of various stakeholder groups in national incident response, existing coordination mechanisms and alignment to national-level doctrine, as well as information sharing to support decision-making throughout the lifecycle of an incident.\nAdditionally, CISA hosted three public listening sessions that proved very informative and beneficial in our quest to gather and incorporate stakeholder perspectives. In each session, more than 100 attendees tuned in to learn about the NCIRP Update development process and provide input on topics ranging from the role of SLTT entities in cyber response to CISA’s plans for implementation following the release of NCIRP.\nLastly, CISA published newsletters with regular updates on the planning effort.\nThe draft NCIRP Update reflects the evolution in the cybersecurity landscape and lessons learned from historical incidents. It also encapsulates the critical role the broad critical infrastructure community plays in national incident response and the efficiencies to be had through deeper unity of effort.\nMore perspectives will help us further strengthen the final NCIRP.

Any interruption in communications can have a cascading effect, impacting a public safety agency’s ability to deliver critical lifesaving services to the community. Therefore, public safety agencies carefully plan, implement, and review communications capabilities for resiliency to maintain daily communications capabilities and prepare in advance for emergency events.\nAuthor: Dave Nolan, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Emerging and Advanced Technology Branch, Nationwide Interoperability Services\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) collaborates with public safety, national security, and emergency preparedness communities to enhance seamless and secure communications to keep America safe, secure, and resilient. Any interruption in communications can have a cascading effect, impacting a public safety agency’s ability to deliver critical lifesaving services to the community. Therefore, public safety agencies carefully plan, implement, and review communications capabilities for resiliency to maintain daily communications capabilities and prepare in advance for emergency events.\nTo assist public safety agencies with navigating the wealth of information available regarding communications resiliency, CISA created the\nPublic Safety Communications and Cyber Resiliency Toolkit\nto identify and address emergent trends and issues, consolidate resources, educate stakeholders at all levels of government, and propose mitigations to enable resilient public safety communications. The Toolkit is designed to assist public safety agencies and others responsible for communications networks by providing the tools necessary to evaluate current resiliency capabilities, identify ways to improve resiliency, and develop plans for mitigating the effects of potential resiliency threats.\nThrough the use of an interactive graphic displaying components of the emergency communications ecosystem, Toolkit users can easily navigate through a number of topics and access applicable resources. Current topic areas include:\nAlerts, Warnings, and Notifications\nElectromagnetic Pulse (EMP)\nLand Mobile Radio (LMR)\nLocal Access Networks (LAN)\nNext Generation 911 (NG911)\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Disruptions\nResiliency Introduction\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)\nAs part of CISA’s commitment to provide the most up-to-date information in support of communications and cyber resiliency, the Toolkit is designed to be a living document, with the ability to grow and expand as new resources are developed and identified. Since its last update in April 2024, the Toolkit has been updated to Version 24.2 with seven new resources. Users are encouraged to revisit the Toolkit on a regular basis to take advantage of recently added information and resources. Check out the updates today at\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/communications-resiliency\nFor more information and additional guidance regarding communications resiliency, visit\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/safecom/technology\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

The recommended practices are for network engineers and defenders of communications infrastructure to strengthen visibility and harden network devices against this broad and significant cyber espionage campaign.\nCISA and FBI recently warned of this\n. This guide recommends actions to quickly identify anomalous behavior, vulnerabilities and threats, and to respond to a cyber incident. It also guides organizations to reduce existing vulnerabilities, improve secure configuration habits, and limit potential entry points.\n“The PRC-affiliated cyber activity poses a serious threat to critical infrastructure, government agencies, and businesses. This guide will help telecommunications and other organizations detect and prevent compromises by the PRC and other cyber actors,” said\nCISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Jeff Greene\n. “Along with our US and international partners, we urge software manufacturers to incorporate Secure by Design principles into their development lifecycle to strengthen the security posture of their customers. Software manufacturers should review our\nSecure by Design resources\nand put their principles into practice.”\n“Threat actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) are have targeted commercial telecommunications providers to compromise sensitive data and engage in cyber espionage,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “Together with our interagency partners, the FBI issued guidance to enhance the visibility of network defenders and to harden devices against PRC exploitation. We strongly encourage organizations to review and implement the recommended measures in this guide and to report suspicious activity to their local FBI field office.”\nAlthough tailored to communications infrastructure sector, this guidance may also apply to organizations with on-premises enterprise equipment.

      "author": "treating AI TEVV as a subset of traditional software TEVV, the AI evaluations community benefits from using and building upon decades of proven and tested approaches towards assuring software is fit for purpose. Additionally, by streamlining processes, enterprises can avoid standing up parallel testing processes to accomplish similar ends, saving time and resources.Most notably, with the knowledge that software and AI TEVV must be treated similarly to software TEVV from a strategic and operational perspective, the digital ecosystem can instead channel effort at the tactical level, developing novel tools, applications, and benchmarks to robustly execute AI TEVV. 1 The US Department of Defense publications in the Rainbow Series in the 1980s represent major development in the history of cybersecurity guidance and requirements. See NSA/NCSC Rainbow Series.2 Some organizations approach software TEVV as a part of a broader product quality management regime, as defined by the processes and practices necessary for conformance with the ISO 9000 series of publications. For example, NIST SP 800-160r1 applies ISO 9000 definitions for validation and verification directly to the topic of engineering trustworthy, secure information systems. However, NIST SP 800-160r1 refers to a different ISO standard (29119-2:2021 – Software and systems engineering – Software testing) to define testing. There are several other documents referenced by SP 800-160r1 for evaluation criteria and processes. While SP 800-160r1 does not title itself a TEVV process manual, it does in fact define and inter-relate the processes for software testing, evaluation, validation, and verification.3 NIST defines “security” as resistance to intentional, unauthorized act(s) designed to cause harm or damage to a system; “safety” is a property of a system such that it does not, under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered.

      "content": "AI Red Teaming: Applying Software TEVV for AI Evaluations\nBy: Jonathan Spring, Deputy Chief AI Officer and Divjot Singh Bawa, Strategic Advisor\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nCyber Threats and Advisories\nfor critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA is\nacross the digital ecosystem and helping protect critical infrastructure from malicious uses of AI. To effectively mitigate against critical failures, physical attacks, and cyberattacks, AI software developers must prioritize conducting rigorous safety and security testing to understand how an AI system can fail or be exploited.\nAI red teaming is a foundational component of the safety and security evaluations process.\nThis blogpost demonstrates that AI red teaming must fit into the existing framework for AI Testing, Evaluation, Validation and Verification (TEVV). Additionally, the post explains how and why AI TEVV must fit into software TEVV, ensuring AI systems are\n. While there are differences in the specific software tools used, AI TEVV—despite common misconceptions—must be treated under software TEVV from a strategic and operational perspective.\nThis assertion is grounded in the fact that TEVV has been used for more than four decades to improve the safety and security of software.\nExperts working on AI evaluations should avoid reinventing the wheel and build upon lessons the software security community has learned through developing and improving guidance and requirements.\nFraming AI Red Teaming in the Context of TEVV\nis the third-party safety and security evaluation of AI systems; AI red teaming is a subset of AI Testing, Evaluation, Verification and Validation (TEVV).\n, a broader risk-based approach for the external testing of AI systems, has been developed and operationalized by our interagency partners at the National Institute of Standards (NIST) through programs like\nAssessing Risks and Impacts of AI (ARIA)\nBecause AI systems are a\ntype of software system\n, approaches for AI TEVV must fundamentally be a sub-component of the more established software TEVV.\nThe TEVV framework is commonly used to test software reliability and help ensure that software is\n. TEVV can broadly be deconstructed into three components:\nsoftware system test and evaluation process\nsoftware verification\nSoftware TEVV Can be Used for AI Evaluations\nA common misconception surrounding AI evaluation methods is that the established software TEVV framework is not, or cannot be, adapted to account for the evaluation of AI systems.\nHowever, while there are tactical implementation and technical details that differ between AI TEVV and software TEVV, the two processes—from a strategic and operational vantage point—are quite similar. There are three truths about all software systems that illuminate this assertion:\n1. Software systems have always had safety risks\nOne pervasive example that fuels the misconception that AI and software TEVV are dissimilar is the narrative that AI evaluations are unique because of the need to mitigate risk posed by potential security vulnerabilities and safety violations.\nWhile true, many software developers have long had to consider both the security and safety dimensions within traditional software systems.\nFor example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves medical devices for use within the United States. Since the 1980s, some medical devices have had a software component, a trend that is increasingly common today. In 1986, software flaws in a cancer radiotherapy device, the Therac-25, led to several deaths.\nThe software flaw was a\n, a type of error where operations are not executed in the correct order, resulting in unexpected outcomes. They occur often unpredictably and arise due to complex interactions between components and data. Race conditions are often hard to reproduce and identifying which single lines of code require modification to fix the flaw can be challenging.\nWhile the FDA’s device approval process has since been\n, the Therac-25 incident demonstrates how traditional software can have fatal consequences for human safety. Medical devices are not uniquely susceptible to software safety risks; many other critical infrastructure sectors also employ safety critical software. Examples include\n, among many others. AI systems, as one type of software system, should similarly be evaluated for safety concerns, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and in particular cybersecurity issues that could be exploited to cause safety issues.\n2. Software systems require validity and reliability testing\nAnother common misconception is that AI systems must distinctively be tested for\nvalidity and reliability\n, preventing the deployment of AI systems which are inaccurate, unreliable, or poorly generalized to data.\nHowever, mitigating against validity and reliability concerns while also ensuring the robustness of software against novel situations and inputs is common to both software and AI. For example, modern road vehicle braking systems often heavily rely on software to work effectively. Automated braking software interprets data from sensors and assists when a driver may not react a hazard in time.\nThis safety-critical software must demonstrate robustness to a variety of events and conditions, like unexpected pedestrians, slick roads, or the driver following too closely behind another car. Designers of all safety-critical software systems, whether they include an AI-element or not, must consider a range of factors including the dynamics of the system, the probability of certain external events, and the desired degree of “safety margin” given the impact of the system losing control. Additionally, rigorous testing is applied to ensure that the real system reflects the intended design assumptions.\nWhile AI systems can be more complex than this simple example, many of the concepts and techniques from evaluating and modeling software robustness against unexpected inputs are akin to those used in traditional software evaluations.\n3. Software systems are fundamentally probabilistic\nFinally, many point to how AI systems, constructed with probabilities and commonly created with intentional variance to avoid producing repetitive results, often need multiple trials to discover improper behavior. This concern surrounding variability also extends to how outputs from AI systems may differ entirely even with small changes to configuration details or training data.\nHowever, traditional software systems are also inherently unpredictable and can exhibit wildly different behavior based on small changes in input if appropriate safeguards are not implemented. Broadly, one cannot prove any non-trivial properties of any computer program in general ahead of time (i.e.,\nHowever, more operationally relevant are security vulnerabilities where a change to one or a few bytes in the input from the network can lead to total control of the machine by a threat actor; this happened with the popular web server NGINX in 2021 (\n). Some classes of vulnerabilities, like race conditions, are not deterministic in any software system. Software engineers may also intentionally create controlled randomness in computer processes; this is a core function of cryptography.\nCharacteristics that may seem more prominent or concerning in AI systems (safety concerns, testing for validity and reliability, their probabilistic nature) have always been present in traditional software systems. As such, the well-established software TEVV methodology is a perfectly valid approach from which to conduct AI evaluations. Yes, there are differences with AI that require some adaptation, but none so large as to warrant a drastically different approach.\nCISA's Role in AI TEVV\nAs the AI evaluations field continues to mature, there is an array of diverse stakeholders working to advance the science and practice of AI red teaming. This includes developing novel methodologies, creating tools that are interoperable across models or platforms, and improving capabilities to conduct AI red teaming at scale.\nand an operational lead for federal cybersecurity, CISA focuses on contributing to AI red teaming efforts that primarily support security evaluations for Federal and non-Federal entities; this work is organized into three broad workstreams.\nFirst, CISA remains steadfast in ensuring that our work on AI pre-deployment testing supplements efforts in industry, academia, and government. CISA is a founding member of the recently\nTesting Risks of AI for National Security (TRAINS) Taskforce, which will include testing of advanced AI models across national security and public safety domains. Led by the NIST AI Safety Institute, CISA will contribute expertise both by helping build new AI evaluation methods and benchmarks that integrate with security testing processes, as well as providing subject matter expertise on cybersecurity testing. For much of this work, CISA will rely upon Vulnerability Management within CISA’s Cybersecurity Division, which offers CISA security evaluation services such as\nRisk and Vulnerability Assessments\nSecond, CISA continues to provide technical assistance and risk management support to Federal and non-Federal partners, specifically supporting AI security technical post-deployment testing. This includes varied forms of testing, such as\nvulnerability scanning\nconfiguration testing\n. CISA also often works independently to detect and identify security vulnerabilities impacting critical infrastructure systems and devices. CISA has already begun to receive requests from partners to conduct penetration and technical security testing on Large Language Models (LLMs) and expects demand for these services to grow as partners increasingly adopt AI tools.\nThird, CISA collaborates with NIST on the development of standards for AI security testing. CISA provides operational cybersecurity expertise to help make standards practicable. Additionally, CISA builds on NIST standards to provide high-quality services and advice to our partners. CISA security evaluation services, such as red teaming, include AI systems in the scope of those security assessment services. CISA also provides operational guidance for securing software systems, such as the\ncross-sector cybersecurity performance goals\n, and priority security practices for AI systems, such as the Secure by Design\nBy treating AI TEVV as a subset of traditional software TEVV, the AI evaluations community benefits from using and building upon decades of proven and tested approaches towards assuring software is fit for purpose. Additionally, by streamlining processes, enterprises can avoid standing up parallel testing processes to accomplish similar ends, saving time and resources.\nMost notably, with the knowledge that software and AI TEVV must be treated similarly to software TEVV from a strategic and operational perspective, the digital ecosystem can instead channel effort at the tactical level, developing novel tools, applications, and benchmarks to robustly execute AI TEVV.\nThe US Department of Defense publications in the Rainbow Series in the 1980s represent major development in the history of cybersecurity guidance and requirements. See\nNSA/NCSC Rainbow Series\nSome organizations approach software TEVV as a part of a broader product quality management regime, as defined by the processes and practices necessary for conformance with the ISO 9000 series of publications. For example, NIST SP 800-160r1 applies ISO 9000 definitions for validation and verification directly to the topic of engineering trustworthy, secure information systems. However, NIST SP 800-160r1 refers to a different ISO standard (29119-2:2021 – Software and systems engineering – Software testing) to define testing. There are several other documents referenced by SP 800-160r1 for evaluation criteria and processes. While SP 800-160r1 does not title itself a TEVV process manual, it does in fact define and inter-relate the processes for software testing, evaluation, validation, and verification.\nNIST defines “security” as resistance to intentional, unauthorized act(s) designed to cause harm or damage to a system; “safety” is a property of a system such that it does not, under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered.

Our goal is to not only celebrate our team’s ingenuity and dedication but also to inspire others in the federal government to envision the possibilities of adopting a similar approach. We also hope this message informs and inspires other students, the future cyber leaders, to join CISA or similar organizations within the federal government.\nThe Vulnerability Management subdivision focuses on proactive vulnerability discovery and mitigation, technical and cybersecurity maturity-based assessments, and operational technology (OT) and software security. This unique and broad mission to bolster America’s cybersecurity posture presents challenges that need diverse insights and often additional human resources.\nTo tackle these challenges, we lean into support from collaborations and partnerships with industry, Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), and academia. In addition, we prioritize connecting with highly creative problem-solving people as early in their career paths as possible to include our intern selections.\nIn January, our journey to identify prospective interns began at the Scholarship for Service (SFS) annual conference hosted by Office of Personnel Management (OPM ) in DC. Our team of experts set high expectations to spot diverse and motivated top-talent! As summer began, 17 exceptional interns from the SFS Program, Pathways, and the CISA Neurodiverse Federal Workforce (NFW) Initiative joined our team.\nWe assigned these interns to tackle real, challenging problems across the spectrum of our mission space. These projects included ransomware, vulnerability disclosure, open-source intelligence research, security researcher engagement, penetration testing automation, knowledge management, operations, and vulnerability analysis and discovery.\nWe are thankful to the following interns for their contributions to our mission:\nElisabeth S., a Cadet at The Citadel, Military College of South Carolina, developed ransomware vulnerability guidance for K-12 stakeholders, enhancing awareness of critical vulnerabilities and reducing the time to mitigate vulnerabilities prior to ransomware encryption.\nKaren E., from Old Dominion University, developed a strategy that reduced the time to process vulnerability disclosure information by 30%, with research that analyzed 7,100 vulnerabilities, and 2,546 published advisories.\nAston P., from Michigan Technological University, developed automations for the Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Reporting Engine reducing the need for manual reporting activities and saving a significant amount of time on assessments.\nFanta D., from University of Massachusetts, analyzed assessment surveys evaluate how often the customers implemented CISA’s risk reduction recommendations.\nGregory W., from Old Dominion University, designed a Search Center that allows employees to search the VM Information Hub and related sites, which increases efficiency across the subdivision when looking for workforce and mission-related information.\nSophia H., from Kansas State University, performed market research, capability, and legal analysis to enhance VM operations through the integration of open-source information and tools.\nLaura S., from Fordham University, developed an automated tool using Python to parse scanning data, directly update vulnerability findings and optimizing assessment completion times.\nLucas S., from Oregon State University, developed automated scripts to monitor the data quality and completeness trends for CVEs. Through his analysis of security.txt file adoption, he identified thousands of sites and leveraged this critical technology, to uncover security.txt information used to analyze cybersecurity maturity.\nNia P., from Rochester Institute of Technology and Anthony Bartuch, from Marymount University teamed up and enhanced the Micro Evaluation Security Assessment (MESA) tool. This is a new tool being developed that enables assessment execution scaling. These efforts enhanced the tool's usability and automation, improving our success criteria for regional transition.\nElijah G., from Old Dominion University, used Packer, Ansible, and Terraform to automate the creation of virtual machines. His development efforts reduced the time required to patch the old infrastructure and automate the creation of new, and fully secured infrastructure used to support technical assessments.\nHannah B., from Old Dominion University, enhanced vulnerability open-source information gathering and security researcher partnership efforts. Her analysis enabled VM to implement an operationally dynamic communication method with valuable security researchers.\nAnamaria Alvarez C., from Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico, created training materials on various platforms for vulnerability hunting.

However, when integrated into a team, “together everyone achieves more.” If you’re a student, intern, or new graduate, you have valuable skills and talents that our nation needs!\nCISA’s overall involvement in connecting with students and recent graduates has us participating in over 25 different programs, including six dedicated solely to internships. In fiscal year 2024, more than 78 interns from diverse backgrounds and institutions, including the United States Military Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and Stanford University, served across the agency. We’ve noticed a rising interest in policy-focused students, with strong participation from law schools seeking vital cybersecurity experience to prepare future cyber policymakers. CISA also recently formed an agreement with Harvard University that allows their students to participate in a summer internship rotation in 2025. This growing interest signals a positive trend and indicates that CISA will continue to lead and benefit from the development of future cyber leaders in government!\nFor more information about how to participate in CISA’s internship program, please visit this site:\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/students-recent-graduates-employment-opportunities\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

The safety and security of the nation depends on the ability of critical infrastructure owners and operators to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. That’s why this November we are continuing with our enduring theme of\nResolve to be Resilient\n“We must build resilience into our preparedness planning year-around,” said\nDr. David Mussington, CISA’s Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security\n. “It's a whole of community responsibility to prepare and secure the nation’s critical infrastructure and protect the vital services it provides, so when something does happen, we are better able to respond to and recover from any impacts.”\nThroughout November, we’ll highlight how critical infrastructure organizations can integrate the following practices to help make our critical infrastructure secure, resilient, and able to bounce back quickly and build back stronger when disruptions occur:\nKnow Your Infrastructure and Dependencies.\nOrganizations should identify their most critical systems and assets for their operations and understand potential dependencies on other infrastructure systems and assets that enable the continuity of their own operations.\nConsider the full range of threats and hazards that could disrupt your organization’s infrastructure operations and evaluate specific vulnerabilities and consequences the threats and hazards could pose.\nMake Actionable Plans.\nOrganizations should develop both a strategic risk management plan to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities identified and an actionable incident response and recovery plan to help withstand and rapidly restore operations within minimal downtime.\nMeasure Progress to Continuously Improve\n. Exercise incident response and recovery plans under realistic conditions and periodically evaluate and update strategic plans. An organization’s ability to proactively prepare for and adapt to changing risk conditions starts with fostering a culture of continuous improvement, based on lessons learned from exercises and real-world incidents.\nAs a nation, we are grappling with continued cyber and physical threats to critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day. We have seen increasing threats of violence; extended, record-breaking heat and destructive weather and fire events; global conflicts with ripple effects around the world, including civil disturbances at home; and rapid advances in technology that enable novel cybersecurity risks.\nCISR Month is CISA’s annual effort to educate and engage all levels of government, infrastructure owners and operators, and the American public about the vital role critical infrastructure plays in the nation’s security and why it is important to strengthen critical infrastructure resilience. Incorporating the resilience strategies above into planning helps protect lives and jobs, keeps communities connected, reduces economic disruptions to supply chains, and encourages innovative solutions to reduce harm to communities.\nCISA encourages everyone to explore the resources on our\nCritical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (CISR) Month\nwebpage, which includes a\nand social media graphics.

I want to express my deep gratitude to the state and local election officials and the hundreds of thousands of Americans who served as poll workers yesterday. As the lead federal government agency for election infrastructure security, CISA is proud to call them partners. It is because of their tireless efforts that we can all have confidence in the security and resilience of our elections.\nAs we have said repeatedly, our election infrastructure has never been more secure and the election community never better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections for the American people. This is what we saw yesterday in the peaceful and secure exercise of democracy. Importantly, we have no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.\nNow, election officials will carry out their duty to certify the results and ensure that every eligible vote has been counted as cast. The United States government supported these partners throughout the election, bringing the full range of capabilities to bear in securing systems and pushing back against malicious actors seeking to disrupt our process and influence our election. CISA will continue to support our state and local partners as they move toward their certification deadlines and the official outcome of the 2024 elections.\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA and EAC in Support of State and Local Election Officials\nCISA Launches #PROTECT2024 Election Threat Updates Webpage\nCISA and USPIS Release Two Election Mail Security Resources\nFBI and CISA Issue Public Service Announcement Warning of Tactics Foreign Threat Actors are Using to Spread Disinformation in the 2024 U.S. General Election",

Election officials make it possible for Americans to safely and securely participate in tomorrow’s general election. Planning for tomorrow’s election began four years ago, and the election community is prepared. Our members, along with their colleagues at the local level, have devoted extensive time, energy and resources to safeguard America’s elec­tions.\n“As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues may arise: for example, voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy periods, or an area could lose power. These are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day, but election officials have contin­gency plans for these and other scenarios. Americans can have confidence the election is secure, and the results will be counted accurately.\n“Remember election night results are always unofficial. While the focus on election night is on who won and who lost, those races are called by the media, not election officials. In the days and weeks to come, election officials will count every eligible ballot, including ballots cast in-person on or before Election Day, mail ballots, provisional ballots, and ballots cast by military and overseas voters. Accurately counting millions of ballots takes time and it is important to be patient. Some races will be close and may require a recount or a recanvass. Many election officials will also con­duct audits to verify the accuracy of the results. We implore all Americans to understand these pro­cesses are normal and done in accordance with state and territorial law.\n“There are thousands of state and local races on the ballot across the country, in addition to the presidential race. We encourage eligible voters who have not already cast their ballots to do so tomorrow.”\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nStatement from CISA Director Easterly on the Security of the 2024 Elections\nCISA Launches #PROTECT2024 Election Threat Updates Webpage\nCISA and USPIS Release Two Election Mail Security Resources\nFBI and CISA Issue Public Service Announcement Warning of Tactics Foreign Threat Actors are Using to Spread Disinformation in the 2024 U.S. General Election",

      "content": "Engaging with Security Researchers: Embracing a “See Something, Say Something” Culture\nTod Beardsley, Known Exploited Vulnerability Team Lead & Daniel Larson, Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Team Lead\nCyber Threats and Advisories\nIn an age where digital systems have an electronic tendril in nearly every aspect of our lives, the role of cybersecurity researchers is more important than ever. These individuals and groups proactively identify weaknesses in software, networks, and hardware, often before malicious actors get a chance to exploit them. Yet even though we’ve collectively developed a set of norms and standards for\ncoordinated vulnerability disclosure\n, companies, open-source projects, and government agencies sometimes respond to these unsolicited reports with fear, uncertainty, and doubt, rather than engagement, driving away the very allies we all rely on to keep our systems safe.\n“See Something, Say Something”\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS)\n“See Something, Say Something”\ncampaign is a cornerstone of public safety. It encourages people to report suspicious activity to the authorities who are best equipped to assess and handle the potential threat. At CISA, we adhere to the very same principle in the online world. Information security researchers act as the digital equivalents of observant citizens, uncovering flaws in systems that could otherwise be exploited by criminals and foreign threat actors.\nBased on our experience, when a researcher finds a vulnerability, more often than not, they’ll do what any reasonable person would do: notify the right people to fix the problem. When it’s a bug in widely used software, the owner or producer of the software would be notified and is usually best positioned to address the issue. For this process to work effectively, researchers should feel they can safely report vulnerabilities without fear of reprisal.\nFor federal agencies, CISA encourages this practice through\nBinding Operational Directive 20-01\n, which requires federal agencies to publish both a security contact for each .gov domain and a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) covering all of the agency’s internet-accessible systems and services.  Further, the agency-crafted VDP must address numerous critical topics, including a commitment to not recommend or pursue legal action against anyone for security research activities that the agency concludes represents a good faith effort to follow the VDP, as well as deem such activities authorized by the agency.\nWhat, exactly, should an organization expect for a typical coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD)? The most optimal, by-the-book journey of a vulnerability notification would go something like this:\nIdentification and Reporting:\nThe vulnerability is discovered by the researcher and reported through a designated security contact for the affected organization. Reports may be submitted to any available contact or web form found on the affected organization’s public website. Based on our role as the Federal Government’s central CVD team, our experience tells us contacting the right people is often the greatest hurdle for researchers.\nThe affected organization acknowledges the receipt of the vulnerability report and provides the researcher an estimated timeline for future communication. The organization might request more information from the researcher to better understand the report or their disclosure timeline.\nAssessment and Validation:\nThe organization then assesses the validity and severity of the reported vulnerability. This may require a discussion with the researcher and in-depth knowledge of how the vulnerability is exploitable. Utilizing the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) are widely accepted as criteria used to determine the severity of vulnerabilities.\n: Once validated, the organization fixes or mitigates the vulnerability and thoroughly tests the fix to ensure the vulnerability is resolved without introducing new problems. The researcher is often able and willing to help test and validate the mitigations.\n: The organization and the researcher agree on a publication timeline. High level details of the vulnerability, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) specification, mitigations, severity ratings, a Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) identification number, and researcher acknowledgement are publicly published by the organization and possibly the researcher. This aims to balance transparency with security by informing users, developers, and security professionals about potential risks and encourages patches and mitigation strategies.\nEnsuring Clear Communications During a Crisis\nWhen a vulnerability or breach comes to light, involving legal counsel can be both prudent and entirely routine. Staff attorneys help organizations navigate regulatory obligations, potential liabilities, and any contractual requirements. However, while soliciting legal advice is a critical component of any crisis communications plan, it’s also critical to appreciate the context of the situation. How an organization responds publicly, and how it interacts with the security researcher, can shape public perception and the ultimate resolution of the issue.\nA few key crisis communication best practices can help maintain credibility:\nAcknowledge the issue\n: Even if all the details aren’t available, make it clear that you are aware of the issue and working toward a resolution. Avoid the perception of being dismissive, excuse-making, or victim-blaming.\nEngage researchers constructively\n: Without the efforts of security researchers, you would likely remain in the dark about the issue in the first place, placing your users, employees, customers, and constituencies at risk.\nProvide timely updates\n: Transparency and regular communication fosters trust and even bad news provides some level of reassurance.\nDon’t shoot the messenger\n: Punishing researchers with legal threats is not productive, as it may backfire and undo the positive perception of work done in addressing the issue. It not only creates an adversarial relationship with the very person seeing something and saying something, but can alienate the research community, and even the general public. Demonstrating cooperation shows commitment to cybersecurity, accountability, and transparency; these are core values we promote in our\nSecure by Design campaign\nOrganizations should view these incidents as opportunities to improve their security posture, showcase their response capabilities, and demonstrate a willingness to learn. Working collaboratively with researchers is not only productive for affected organizations, but it also strengthens relationships with the security community which will certainly pay dividends in the years ahead. Today’s crisis is tomorrow’s case study.\nOrganized Security Researcher Support\nForward-thinking organizations are already embracing bug bounty programs and formal vulnerability disclosure processes. These initiatives send a clear message: reasonable disclosure is welcome, and it will be handled professionally. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have seen tremendous value in these programs, as well as have government agencies like\n. These programs allow organizations to roll out patches quickly and before bad actors can take advantage of issues at scale.\nGovernments, too, can benefit from engaging security researchers. With critical infrastructure at risk, public entities must encourage vulnerability reporting. Establishing a clear and welcoming process for reasonable disclosure ensures that researchers know how to report vulnerabilities and feel confident that their findings will be handled in good faith.\nA Culture of Collaboration\nTo protect our nation’s digital infrastructure, we must adopt a “See Something, Say Something” mindset in cybersecurity. When researchers report vulnerabilities or evidence of breaches, organizations should engage them as partners rather than adversaries. Involving legal counsel may be a necessary step in handling these situations, but the broader response must focus on resolving the issue and maintaining public trust. Fostering a culture of transparency and awareness is essential to ensuring that your organization emerges stronger and more secure from a potential crisis.\nOrganizations can also take inspiration from CISA, which has committed to coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) and encourages the public to report incidents and vulnerabilities. More information on reporting can be found at\nIncidentally, if you’re interested in having a more direct hand in vulnerability disclosure for your own products and services, consider becoming a\nCVE Numbering Authority\n. CISA has worked diligently to grow our community of CNAs. There are over 400 CNAs today; this community is global and is made up of many major technology vendors across IT and OT. It’s a pretty cool community to be a part of, and we here at CISA are happy to help get you started on the path towards joining!\nTogether with a culture of collaboration with security researchers, companies, open-source projects, and governments alike, we can all bolster defenses and create a safer digital culture for everyone.\nAI Red Teaming: Applying Software TEVV for AI Evaluations\nUnder the Digital Radar: Defending Against People’s Republic of China’s Nation-State Cyber Threats to America’s Small Businesses\nCyber Hygiene Helps Organizations Mitigate Ransomware-Related Vulnerabilities\nCISA Hosts Second Cyber Resilient 911 Symposium",

Election security is national security. Our foreign adversaries are looking to attack our democratic process to further their own objectives, and we need the help of all Americans in ensuring they are not successful,” said\nCISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley\n.  “There has been incredible effort across local, state and federal governments to ensure the security and integrity of our nation’s election infrastructure. Americans should be confident that their votes will be counted as cast.  They should also know that our foreign adversaries will try to make them believe otherwise. We encourage everyone to remain vigilant, verify the information they consume, and rely on trusted sources like their state and local election officials.”\nThe PSA highlights specific examples of tactics we have seen used by Russia and Iran during the 2024 election cycle to target all Americans. These include things from mimicking national level media outlets like the Washington Post and Fox News and creating inauthentic news sites posing as legitimate media organizations to using paid influencers to hide their hand. It is important for voters to critically evaluate information sources, particularly as disinformation campaigns evolve to use AI-generated content. Both agencies urge the American public to rely on trusted information from state and local election officials and to verify claims through multiple reliable sources before sharing them on social media or other platforms.\nFor more information on how to protect yourself from disinformation, visit the official websites of the FBI and CISA’s dedicated election security webpage,\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nStatement from CISA Director Easterly on the Security of the 2024 Elections\nJoint Statement from CISA and EAC in Support of State and Local Election Officials\nCISA Launches #PROTECT2024 Election Threat Updates Webpage\nCISA and USPIS Release Two Election Mail Security Resources",

This catalog outlines practices that are deemed exceptionally risky and provides recommendations for software manufacturers to mitigate these risks. It urges software manufacturers to avoid these bad practices, especially those who produce software used in service of critical infrastructure or national critical functions (NCFs). Members of the public\nmay submit public comment\non this guidance starting today.\nThe National Cybersecurity Strategy calls for a fundamental shift to rebalance the responsibility to defend cyber space onto those best positioned to bear it; namely, the software manufacturers who build products underpinning our collective digital infrastructure. Fully realizing this shift requires an understanding of the most egregious software development practices that software manufacturers must avoid. This catalog enumerates such practices.\n“It’s 2024, and basic, preventable software defects continue to enable crippling attacks against hospitals, schools, and other critical infrastructure. This has to stop. These product security bad practices pose unacceptable risks in this day and age, and yet are all too common.” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “We hope that by following this clear-cut, voluntary guidance, software manufacturers can lead by example in taking ownership of their customers’ security outcomes and fostering a secure by design future. Please provide input and let us know how we can improve this list of bad practices.”\n“Our National Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the importance of securing our nation’s critical infrastructure and shoring up our cyber defenses,” said\nWhite House National Cyber Director Harry Coker Jr\n. “The impact of product security bad practices has wide-ranging consequences across our nation and is often felt by the American people. Our private sector partners must shoulder their responsibility and build secure products and I’m glad to see this document as another tool to help software manufacturers do just that. We need to work together to prioritize best practices to better protect our nation.”\n“Bad practices in software development, especially when that software will be used by critical infrastructure, put both customers and our national security at risk,” said\nAssistant Director of the FBI’s Cyber Division Bryan Vorndran\n. “The FBI urges software manufacturers to avoid the risky practices described in this guidance, which lead to vulnerabilities that malicious actors routinely exploit.”\nThese product security bad practices represent the next major step in CISA and partners’ global Secure by Design initiative, which has joined forces with 18 U.S. and international agencies to publish\nand catalyzed commitments from over 220 software manufacturers to\nCISA’s Secure by Design Pledge\n. The bad practices build on practices laid out in the pledge and other guidance including\nNIST’s Secure Software Development Framework\n. This catalog will be a central guiding document in CISA’s Secure by Design initiative going forward, playing a key role informing future guidance and actions.\nThis joint guidance lists the bad practices in three categories:\nProduct properties, which describe observable, security-related qualities of a software product.\nSecurity features, which describe the security functionalities that a product supports.\nOrganizational processes and policies, which describe the actions taken by a software manufacturer to ensure strong transparency in its approach to security.\nCISA selected the bad practices based on the threat landscape as representing the most dangerous and pressing items that software manufacturers should avoid.\nThe public comment period concludes on Monday, December 16, 2024. During the comment period, members of the public can provide comments and feedback via the Federal Register at\nRequest for Comment on Product Security Bad Practices Guidance\n. Following the public comment period, CISA will issue a revised version of the bad practices.\nTo learn more about the Secure by Design initiative, visit\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

      "content": "CISA Releases Anonymous Threat Response Guidance and Toolkit for K-12 Schools\nNew Resources Will Help K-12 Schools and Law Enforcement Entities Create Tailored Approaches to Addressing Anonymous Threats of Violence\nWASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\nAnonymized Threat Response Guidance: A Toolkit for K-12 Schools\n, a new resource to help kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools and their law enforcement and community partners create tailored approaches to addressing anonymous threats of violence, including those received on social media. The toolkit outlines steps school leaders can take to assess and respond to anonymous threats, better prepare for and prevent future threats, and work in coordination with law enforcement and other local partners when these threats arise. It is co-sealed with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which provided expert feedback on the toolkit’s key principles and strategies.\nSocial media-based and other types of anonymous threats of violence against K-12 institutions are common. These threats can erode trust that schools are safe places, contribute to losses in learning and instruction time, overwhelm school and law enforcement resources and have lasting psychological impacts on school communities.\n“K-12 schools across the country are experiencing a scourge of anonymous threats of violence. School leaders need scalable solutions to navigate these ever-evolving and burdensome threats,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “The K-12 Anonymized Threat Response Guidance provides step-by-step approaches to help schools better assess and respond to these threats, as well as take action to mitigate future risks in coordination with their law enforcement and other community partners.”\n“Families, students and educators should not have to question whether they’re safe when they walk into a classroom,” said\nFBI Office of Partner Engagement Assistant Director, Robert Contee\n. “In the face of these ongoing school threats, the strategies the FBI and our partners at CISA put together will hopefully prepare our educators and administrators to maneuver through difficult challenges. The more parents, teachers and administrators know, the more likely we are to keep our kids safe. The FBI is dedicated to safeguarding schools and communities who are impacted by anonymous threats, but we also want to urge parents to talk with their children about the consequences that come with making these threats. We all need to work together.”\nThe K-12 Anonymized Threat Response Guidance was developed to provide K-12 stakeholders with information to both protect school communities and limit the disruption and trauma that can be caused by anonymous threats of violence. By providing guidance to inform decision-making about the urgency and credibility of individual threats, school and public safety leaders may be able to more effectively balance the full range of risks faced by K-12 organizations.\nThe toolkit emphasizes six key strategies for schools to consider when addressing anonymous threats:\nBuild awareness about reporting to detect threats early and deter future threats.\nDevelop a partnership structure that will help address threats. This includes school administrators, law enforcement personnel and mental health professionals.\nEngage law enforcement to manage threat situations and decide when to scale response actions up or down.\nBalance initial response steps to ensure the campus is safe. Most critically, treat each threat as credible, and from there, work with necessary partners to determine how to approach an immediate response.\nWhen appropriate, tap into multidisciplinary threat assessment teams to support interventions and expedite response if the subject who made the threat becomes known.\nTake steps throughout the school year to prepare for threats. Establish a response protocol and practice other types of emergency management activities, such as training exercises for staff.\nToday’s release also includes a supplemental reference guide that provides streamlined information for K-12 stakeholders to understand and utilize some of the best practices from the full toolkit.

As the operational lead for federal cybersecurity, CISA uses this plan to guide coordinated support and services to agencies, drive progress on a targeted set of priorities, and align collective operational defense capabilities. The end result is reducing the risk to more than 100 FCEB agencies.\nEach FCEB agency has a unique mission, and thus have independent networks and system architectures to advance their critical work. This independence means that agencies have different cyber risk tolerance and strategies. However, a collective approach to cybersecurity reduces risk across the interagency generally and at each agency specifically, and the\noutlines this will occur. CISA developed this plan in collaboration with FCEB agencies to provide standard, essential components of enterprise operational cybersecurity and align collective operational defense capabilities across the federal enterprise.\n“Federal government data and systems interconnect and are always a target for our adversaries. FCEB agencies need to confront this threat in a unified manner and reduce risk proactively,” said\nCISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Jeff Greene.\n“The actions in the FOCAL plan orient and guide FCEB agencies toward effective and collaborative operational cybersecurity and will build resilience. In collaboration with our partner agencies, CISA is modernizing federal agency cybersecurity.”\nis organized into five priority areas that align with agencies’ metrics and reporting requirements. Each priority has goals ranging from addressing universal cybersecurity challenges such as managing the attack surface of internet-accessible assets and bolstering cloud security to long-rage efforts including building a defensible architecture that is resilient in the face of evolving security incidents. The priority areas for FCEB agencies are:\n– fully understand the cyber environment, including the operational terrain and interconnected assets.\nVulnerability Management\n– proactively protect enterprise attack surface and assess defensive capabilities.\nDefensible Architecture\n– design cyber infrastructure with an understanding that security incidents will happen, and that resilience is essential.\nCyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM)\n- quickly identify and mitigate risks, including from third parties, posed to federal IT environments.\nIncident Detection and Response\n- improve the ability of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to detect, respond to, and limit the impact of security incidents.\nwas developed for FCEB agencies, but public and private sector organizations should find it useful as a roadmap to establish their own plan to bolster coordination of their enterprise security capabilities.\nThe Plan is not intended to provide a comprehensive or exhaustive list that an agency or CISA must accomplish. Rather, it is designed to focus resources on actions that substantively advance operational cybersecurity improvements and alignment goals.\nFor more information CISA federal cybersecurity, please see\nCISA-FEIT@cisa.dhs.gov\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team\nCISA Publishes Microsoft Expanded Cloud Log Implementation Playbook\nDHS, CISA Announce Membership Changes to the Cyber Safety Review Board",

      "content": "CISA Director Jen Easterly Remarks at the Election Center 39th Annual National Conference in Detroit\nJen Easterly, CISA Director\nAs prepared for delivery, September 9, 2024\nGood morning. Thank you to the Election Center and to Tammy Patrick for your leadership and service in this critical space. And thank you all for having me here today. My team was especially excited that this year’s conference is taking place in Detroit. I have some Michiganders on my team that have made Jet’s the official CISA pizza of choice in our office. It works particularly well for me as Jet is my son’s name. But children and deep-dish pizza aside, I was personally thrilled to be asked to participate in this conference at this critical time.\nAs Tammy mentioned, I am the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which is the newest agency in the Federal government. Established in 2018 to serve as America’s cyber defense agency and as national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, we are charged to protect and defend the cyber and physical infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day, including the infrastructure that Americans use to cast their votes and ensure that those votes are counted as cast.\nNearly eight years ago, election infrastructure was designated as critical infrastructure, and CISA designated as the federal government lead for election infrastructure security. Since that time, CISA and our partners across the federal government have made significant progress increasing the security and resilience of our Nation’s elections, working to support state and local election officials who serve on the frontlines of our democracy—administering, managing, and securing our elections. And today, because of the incredible work across the election stakeholder community, election infrastructure has never been more secure.\nSo, I first just want to express my sincere thanks to all of you.\nWe owe you our thanks, our respect, and our admiration for your tireless public service to protect and preserve our democracy.\nTo put the importance of your work into context, I want to speak for a moment about another group of public servants whose sacrifice we will also honor in a couple days.\nLet’s go back a few decades to the November 2002 midterm elections. It was a routine federal election by any measure—in fact most of us in this room are probably struggling to remember any details about it other than it happened. Republicans picked up seats in the House and Senate; Democrats picked up seats in state gubernatorial elections. But that’s about it. The 2002 midterm was just another securely run election for the history books. But the fact that the 2002 midterm election was, what we all in the room are hoping for, “just another federal election”, is a testament to election officials around the country.\nJust a year prior our country was rocked by the terror attacks of 9/11. And in two days, Americans across the country will honor those 2,977 lives tragically lost on 9/11 twenty-three years ago. I distinctly remember how in the weeks and months after the terrorist attacks, Americans were encouraged to go back to work; to remain vigilant, but to still find the strength to carry on with business as usual. Reverting to mundane daily activities was a sign that while our country was hurt, it was by no means broken. And looking back, the routine, rather uneventful 2002 midterm election held just a little over 1-year after the attacks—at a time of great uncertainty and concern—was the final and surest sign for the entire world that America’s democracy can and would endure.\nSome of you in this room may have been on the frontlines of our democratic process during the 2002 midterms. Election Center was definitely there supporting election officials around the country. Many of you, like me, may have joined this mission in the years since. I am so inspired by everyone here in this room today because just like those public servants whose service we honor more than twenty years later, you all understand and live the challenges of serving in this space day in and day out, year after year.\nYou all know we are facing the most complex threat environment yet for an election cycle. You all know how much hard work goes into ensuring the security and integrity of our democratic process. And knowing ALL of that, you CHOSE to be part of this sacred mission. You CHOSE to be part of this distinguished community entrusted to protect the most critically important part of our democracy, our elections process. And while this is a tall order, this community has, without fail, delivered safe and secure elections for the American people since the start of this republic. You have faced all sorts of Election Day and voting period crises from natural disasters to global pandemics. But as weeks like this one remind us, our nation has also held elections in the face of more nebulous or existential threats to our democracy.  Time and again we have prevailed, regardless of context and circumstance. The result of your good work and the work done by the election officials who came before you\nthat this country’s secure and resilient elections have become the truest indicator that our democracy is strong and thriving.\nSince taking the reins at CISA more than 3 years ago, I have come to appreciate how none of this good work can be taken for granted. I am acutely aware that all of you are conducting your work in a country that is vastly different than it was two decades ago, and you are staring down threats and challenges that far exceed anything that election officials and administrators had to face in decades past. From intensifying natural disasters to ongoing threats of ransomware, to hack and leaks and denial of service attacks from cyber criminals and foreign adversaries to physical threats to election officials of both parties and their families—you all must operate in an environment that has never been more complex.\nOn top of all of that, as we know from recent warnings from the Intelligence Community, our adversaries—Russia, Iran, and China—remain a persistent threat and will likely attempt to influence our upcoming elections to undermine democratic institutions and foment partisan discord.  Just last month, we issued a statement with the FBI and ODNI confirming reports that Iranian actors have been targeting U.S. presidential campaigns using cyber operations. And just last week, the Justice Department announced the ongoing seizure of 32 internet domains used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns. These domains were used to covertly spread Russian government propaganda, to include influencing voters in the U.S. and foreign elections. These are just the latest attempts by our adversaries to influence our elections, and it certainly won’t be the last. As last week’s activity demonstrates, the Federal government is committed to not only identifying the malicious actions of nation states like Russia, but also looks to disrupt and deter those operations.\nWe should all anticipate that these types of threats will continue in the coming weeks, and as such, we must all be incredibly vigilant, but also know that in doing so we will prevail.\nYou should also know that you are not expected to take on these burdens alone. You are NOT alone in this fight. Defending our democratic process is a top priority at every level of government from the federal to the state to the local. In fact, we are joined here today by many federal colleagues that we at CISA work with day in and day out to support YOU in our unwavering commitment to defend this nation.\nAt CISA, we recognize that we need to take your lead with regard to how, where, and when we provide assistance to support state and local efforts. As anyone who works in elections learns early on—if you’ve seen one state’s election, you’ve seen one state’s election. So, over the years, we have worked with you to better understand your communities’ unique concerns and needs and have calibrated our work accordingly.\nAs an example of this partnership, since the beginning of 2023, CISA has worked with you all and other election infrastructure partners to conduct more than 1,000 physical security assessments, over 700 cyber assessments, to provide weekly vulnerability scanning reports to nearly 1,000 election jurisdictions, and to hold more than 400 trainings reaching tens of thousands of election stakeholders. And just a few weeks ago, we hosted our seventh annual Tabletop the Vote national election exercise with some 1,250 participants representing federal agencies, private sector partners, and election officials from several dozen states and territories.\nJust as we are working to help election stakeholders understand the threat environment, we are also working to help put these threats in context for the public. That’s why we are working with our colleagues at the FBI to do a four-part public service announcement series focused on educating the American people about some of the most common cyber incidents they may see this election cycle, but most importantly why, if the proper layers of physical, cyber, and procedural controls are put in place, those incidents should not impact the vote casting or counting process.\nIn that context, I am excited to announce that today we are releasing two products: physical and cybersecurity checklists for election infrastructure stakeholders. These products will help all of you identify areas to potentially enhance your security and operational resilience at election infrastructure facilities. They also walk you through how to implement low- or no-cost options in the short term. The CISA team here will provide more details on these products in their presentations later today and tomorrow.\nIf you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to take a look at the resources on our Protect2024 website and see what else might be most useful for you and your respective communities as you prepare for November. Make sure to also connect with your region’s election security advisor. These are elections experts who individually bring decades of experience from this community. I have with me today our Region 2 ESA,\n, and our Region 10 ESA,\n. Out in the field our ESAs are your go-to people, but make no mistake, you have the entire agency at your disposal.\nNone of us can predict with certainty what specific challenges November will bring, but what I know to be true is that the extensive contingency planning and preparation you all have done—planning and preparation underpinned by grit and grace, by courage and character, by resilience and resolve—will all ensure you are ready for whatever lies ahead.\nWhen I was 11 years old, my dad took me with him to the inauguration of President Reagan’s. In his address, Reagan noted that “in the eyes of many in the world, this every four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.” It was a miracle then, it was a miracle in 2002, and thanks to this community’s tireless work, this is a miracle I feel confident will no doubt continue this year and beyond.\nI thank you all again for all you do to protect and preserve our most sacred of democratic processes. I wish you all the very best for the coming months, and we at CISA look forward to working alongside you and cheering you on every step of the way.\nDefending Democracy: The #PROTECT2024 Chapter in Election Infrastructure Security\nA Message to Election Officials from CISA Director Jen Easterly\nRegion 10 Team Provides Vital Election Security Training for Idaho\nOpening Statement by CISA Director Jen Easterly at the Update on Foreign Threats to the 2024 Elections Hearing",

The exercise took place over four days, August 22, 23, 26, and 27 and provided participants with the opportunity to share best practices around cyber and physical incident planning, preparedness, identification, response, and recovery.\nFollowing the exercise, CISA Director Jen Easterly, and the Election Infrastructure Subsector Government Coordinating Council (EIS-GCC) Executive Committee, which includes U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Chairman Ben Hovland, NASS President and Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, NASED President and State Elections Director for the New Mexico Secretary of State Mandy Vigil, and Sarah Ball Johnson, City Clerk for the City of Colorado Springs, Colorado, issued the following joint statement:\n“Tabletop the Vote provides an opportunity for the election community as a whole to plan for potential scenarios and improve our response plans within the safety of a training environment.  Exercises like this allow us to prepare for incidents that occur before, during, and after an election and better understand response and recovery efforts.  They also assist us in identifying how to best tackle today’s increasingly complex threat environment by refining communication and intelligence sharing practices, and identifying potential process improvements. Tabletop the Vote is just one example of the ongoing efforts of state and local election officials and the federal government to ensure the security and resilience of America’s most critical democratic process.\n“Elections are run by the thousands of state and local election officials nationwide who work diligently to administer elections that are secure and resilient. It is because of their hard work Americans can have confidence in our nation’s elections.”\nState and local election officials, as well as in-state stakeholders, from across the country participated virtually. In addition to CISA, federal participants in the exercise included the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, U.S. Cyber Command, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the National Guard Bureau, the National Security Council, the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\nThe full EIS-GCC will also be held this week to further foster efficient communication and collaboration within the election infrastructure community ahead of the November general election.\nBoth of these events highlight-the ongoing collaboration between federal, state, local, and private sector members to ensure the security and resilience of our nation’s election infrastructure.\nThe enables state, local, and federal governments to share information and collaborate on best practices to mitigate and counter threats to election infrastructure. The EIS-GCC is composed of representatives from across various levels of government as appropriate to depict the operating landscape of the Election Infrastructure Subsector.\nStatement from CISA Director Easterly on the Security of the 2024 Elections\nJoint Statement from CISA and EAC in Support of State and Local Election Officials\nCISA Launches #PROTECT2024 Election Threat Updates Webpage\nCISA and USPIS Release Two Election Mail Security Resources",

FBI and CISA are issuing this PSA to inform the public that while ransomware attacks against state or local government networks or election infrastructure could cause localized delays, they will not compromise the security or accuracy of vote casting or counting processes.\nTo date, any successful ransomware attack on election infrastructure tracked by the FBI and CISA has remained localized and successfully managed with minimal disruption to election operations and no impact on the security or accuracy of ballot casting or tabulation processes or systems. In prior U.S. and foreign elections, malicious actors have sought to spread or amplify false or exaggerated claims about cyber incidents in an attempt to manipulate public opinion, discredit the electoral process, or undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions. We could see foreign actors attempt to mislead American voters about the actual impact of a ransomware event on elections in this election cycle as part of their larger foreign malign influence campaigns.\nIt is important for the public to know that election officials use a multi-layer approach to security that employs a variety of technological, physical, and procedural controls to prevent cyber intrusions, like ransomware, from impacting the security and resilience of vote casting and counting systems.\n“While ransomware continues to be a significant cybersecurity concern, it is important to note that security measures put in place by election officials and election vendors ensure these incidents will not impact the security of the vote casting or tabulation systems and processes,” said\nCISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley\n. “We will continue to work tirelessly with our election infrastructure partners to uphold the American people’s confidence in 2024 elections and our democratic process.”\n“Combatting ransomware attacks is a top priority for the FBI, especially during elections,” said\nFBI Cyber Division Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser\n. “While the FBI will continue to leverage its tools and partnerships to combat cyber criminals, the public should be aware that ransomware is extremely unlikely to affect the integrity of voting systems or the electoral process.”\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

Red Grasso, North Carolina Department of Information Technology\nSAFECOM, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) premier public safety communications advisory body, is comprised of public safety stakeholders with a diverse set of experiences and backgrounds.\nAuthor: Wes Rogers, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Red Grasso, SAFECOM At-Large (North Carolina Department of Information Technology)\nEmergency Communications\nSAFECOM, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) premier public safety communications advisory body, is comprised of public safety stakeholders with a diverse set of experiences and backgrounds. Mr. Red Grasso, who has been a SAFECOM At-Large member for a year (North Carolina Department of Information Technology), shares some of his insights about SAFECOM and the direction of the public safety communications community.\nRed Grasso, Director of the First Responder Emerging Technologies (FirstTech) Program, North Carolina Department of Information Technology, originally served as the single point of contact for the FirstNet project in North Carolina. Under his leadership, the FirstTech program was developed to bring valuable knowledge to North Carolina’s first responder community and empower them to make informed decisions about their technologies.\nRed received his Bachelor of Science from Western Carolina University in Emergency & Disaster Management and is also a graduate from the Community Preparedness and Disaster Management program at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill. After serving two years in an AmeriCorps program, he spent 10 years as a firefighter with the Town of Morrisville, North Carolina. During this time, Red also served on several committees and working groups focused on radio interoperability at different levels of government. Red was a member of the North Carolina Emergency Management Urban Search & Rescue Task Force 4 and the U.S. Health and Human Service’s National Disaster Medical Service Disaster Medical Assistance Team, focused on providing disaster communications to events around the State of North Carolina and the country. Taking on a more technical role, Red launched a new Project 25 (P25) radio system for public safety in the St. Louis County, Missouri region. Through his leadership and focus, the interoperability policy was developed, and Urban Area Security Initiative grant funding projects were secured Red is also responsible for radio communications for the annual Burning Man event, including coordination with federal and local partners that deploy their own systems.\nCISA: What drew you to joining SAFECOM and what is your role as a SAFECOM member?\nI have had the pleasure of being involved in a number of different working groups over the past decade and I saw the opportunity to become a SAFECOM member as a way to get more involved. SAFECOM’s mission to improve public safety communications fits well with my career path and goals. I find the people involved with SAFECOM to be devoted and great to work with, so the networking opportunity is an added bonus!\nCISA: As a newer SAFECOM member what do you hope to contribute SAFECOM and its mission?\nI have some big shoes to fill as SAFECOM has been in existence since the start of my public safety career and there are many that have contributed over the years. I hope to bring in my experiences and thoughts to the projects that I am working on and be a good example of an active member.\nCISA: What projects at SAFECOM are you currently working on and what projects are you most excited for?\nI currently serve on the Education & Outreach Committee, the P25 User Needs Working Group, and the Joint Communication Section Task Force. I find the work to be rewarding in many ways. It was really interesting to participate in the E&O Committee discussions about last year’s SAFECOM Nationwide Survey and that document will reveal gaps, shape policy, and drive some of the technology discussions. The P25 User Needs Working Group is an amazing opportunity to advance the P25 suite of standards. The Communication Section Task Force is tackling the Information & Communication Technology function within the Incident Command System, and this is inclusive of discussions on current positions such as the Communications Unit Leader (COML) to the development of new positions such as the Information Technology Support Specialist (ITSS), though some of these new positions come to us from other established groups such as National Wildfire Coordinating Group and are being looked to encompass an all-hazards approach.\nCISA: What do you want those who may not know about SAFECOM to know about the program?\nSAFECOM brings together voices from all over the nation and runs the spectrum of agencies and organizations. There are many different issues that SAFECOM looks to address, from the technical to the funding, from the urban to the rural, from sea to shining sea.\nCISA: How do you think SAFECOM will continue to grow and develop in the next couple of years to better help local, tribal, state, territorial and federal agencies?\nI think that SAFECOM will continue to develop knowledge products that will help agencies examine the changing landscape of communication technologies. The close relationship with the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (NCSWIC) brings together a wide view of experiences and two different organizations that are working together to support responders. The outreach and recruitment efforts of SAFECOM will continue to bring in new perspectives and fresh ideas, especially from younger members who might have a new paradigm.\nCISA: How has your involvement in SAFECOM impacted both your community and the public safety community as a whole?\nThere are a lot of ways to be involved with SAFECOM and I am enjoying being a part of a couple of different working groups and the Education & Outreach Committee. I have focused on Land Mobile Radio (LMR) issues during my career, and I find the P25 User Needs Working Group to be a great forum for those end-users to influence the work being done on the P25 suite of standards. I will beat the drum of deprecating the Data Encryption Standard as it gives a false sense of secure communication. The great work being done at the Education & Outreach Committee includes the recent completion of the SAFECOM Nationwide Survey, which will help to provide guidance on future projects and focuses.\nCISA: Where do you see the communications landscape in the next 5-10 years?\nEver since I dropped my Magic 8-ball when I was eight-years-old, and let out all the blue liquid, my ability to predict the future has been hazy! The landscape has evolved to include many different applications designed for a mobile society and we are seeing some of the same challenges to this new reality as the technology moves faster than public safety can keep track. The “interoperability” conversations surrounding the many different Push-To-Talk over Broadband applications reminds me of the earlier days of LMR as new frequency bands and new modulations were introduced. Public safety suffered through those early days, sometimes with systems that only allowed for internal communications, and we are seeing something similar in the application space. We can only work at the speed of government, and these are complex issues as we support the independent decision-making of agencies, so it will be interesting to see how it can be addressed in the near term. SAFECOM is the perfect place to have these conversations.\nCISA: SAFECOM strives to be an active partner to the public safety community at all levels of government. How are you working within the community to highlight the SAFECOM program?\nSAFECOM is a great program to support public safety. I find myself constantly promoting the work done at SAFECOM in things like the NC State Interoperability Executive Committee as we developed our encryption plan and used\nThe Transition to Advanced Encryption Standard White Paper\nfrom SAFECOM or review the Interoperability Continuum as guidance for topics within the committee, particularly data sharing.\nSAFECOM Releases the Emergency Communications System Lifecycle Planning Guide Suite Refresh\nSAFECOM and National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (NCSWIC) develop Artificial Intelligence in Emergency Communications Centers Infographic\nApril is Emergency Communications Month!\nSAFECOM Publishes Fall 2024 SAFECOM Bi-Annual Meeting Executive Summary",

However, they frequently don’t assess whether a given supplier has practices and policies in place to ensure that security is a core consideration from the earliest stages of the product development lifecycle.\nThis guide provides organizations with questions to ask when buying software, considerations to integrate product security into various stages of the procurement lifecycle, and resources to assess product security maturity in line with secure by design principles. Informed by the threat landscape, it provides categorized sets of actions that, if done correctly will demonstrate to the customer that the software manufacturer is taking actions that will drive down exploitable defects and misconfigurations – a safer product for the customer.\n“We are glad to see leading technology vendors recognize that their products need to be more secure and voluntarily join the Secure by Design pledge. Businesses can also help move the needle by making better risk-informed decisions when purchasing software,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “This new guide will help software customers understand how they can use their purchasing power to procure secure products and turn Secure by Design into Secure by Demand.”\nThis guide is concise and usable by any customer of software during procurement discussions with third party resellers or service providers. Recommendations in this guide include obtaining the manufacturer’s software bill of materials that lists third-party software components, roadmaps that identify how they plan to eliminate classes of vulnerability in their products, and publicly available vulnerability disclosure policy, if one is operated.\nThis guide compliments the “\nSoftware Acquisition Guide for Government Enterprise Consumers: Software Assurance in the Cyber-Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Lifecycle\n” that was recently published.\nOrganizations are encouraged to review both the Secure by Demand Guide and Software Acquisition Guide and implement recommended actions.\nFor more information, please visit\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

This public service announcement is to raise awareness that Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on election infrastructure, or adjacent infrastructure that supports election operations, could hinder public access to election information, but would not impact the security or integrity of election processes. The PSA is part of the agencies’ ongoing commitment to provide the public with information and the election infrastructure community with the support they need to run safe and secure elections.\n“With Election Day less than 100 days away, it is important to help put into context some of the incidents the American public may see during the election cycle that, while potentially causing some minor disruptions, will not fundamentally impact the security or integrity of the democratic process,”\nsaid CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley\n. “DDoS attacks are one example of a tactic that we have seen used against election infrastructure in the past and will likely see again in the future, but they will NOT affect the security or integrity of the actual election. They may cause some minor disruptions or prevent the public from receiving timely information. It is important to talk about these potential issues now, because nefarious actors, like our foreign adversaries or cybercriminals, could use DDoS incidents to cast doubt on the election systems or processes. An informed public is key to neutralizing the impact of foreign influence operations and disinformation, which is why we put out this advisory on what a DDoS attack could – and couldn’t – do.”\n“DDoS are low-level attacks that work by overwhelming websites with traffic to render them inaccessible,\"\nsaid FBI Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser\n. “Given the prevalence of false claims about DDoS attacks in prior U.S. and foreign elections, we are warning that DDoS attacks against election-related websites could temporarily disrupt access to some online election functions, like voter look-up tools, but would not prevent voting or compromise the integrity of voting systems. This warning highlights the importance for voters to seek out information about how to vote prior to Election Day and demonstrates the FBI’s and CISA’s continued commitment to sharing information with the public about potential cyber threats.”\nThis publication is to help educate the public on what DDoS attacks are, their effects on election infrastructure, recommendations for voters, and victim reporting information.\nCISA and the FBI encourage the public to report information concerning suspicious or criminal activity, such as DDoS attacks, to their local FBI field office, by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-53240, or online at\n).

      "content": "With Open Source Artificial Intelligence, Don’t Forget the Lessons of Open Source Software\nBy: Jack Cable, Senior Technical Advisor, and Aeva Black, Section Chief, Open Source Security\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nPartnerships and Collaboration\nThe accelerated development of new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, including with large language models (LLMs), has spurred international debates around the potential impact of “open source AI” models. Does open sourcing a model benefit society because it enables developers to rapidly innovate by studying, using, sharing, and collaboratively iterating on these state-of-the-art models? Or do such capabilities pose security threats, allowing adversaries to leverage these models for greater harm?\nFortunately, the conversation isn’t starting from scratch. Developers of all AI models, including open foundation models, can learn from existing work to secure software. As the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) leads on open source software (OSS) security, we’ve spent significant time immersed in open source communities. OSS faced similar debates during the 1990s, and we know that there are many lessons to be learned from the history of OSS.\nto the National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA)\nRequest for Information\non Dual Use Foundation Artificial Intelligence Models With Widely Available Model Weights. At CISA, we see significant value in open foundation models to help strengthen cybersecurity, increase competition, and promote innovation. Our response highlighted that the global AI community should (1) learn from existing software security work and (2) continue to promote the responsible development and release of open foundation models while mitigating their potential harms. There is a tremendous wealth of experience from OSS community that shouldn’t be lost when considering open foundation models.\nWhile there is not yet a consensus on the definition of what constitutes “open source AI”, the\nOpen Source Initiative\n, which maintains the “Open Source Definition” and a list of approved OSS licenses, has been\n“driving a multi-stakeholder process to define an ‘Open Source AI’”\n. Therefore, in the interest of being more precise, we use the term “open foundation models” to refer to AI models with widely available weights.\nLearn from Existing Software Security Work\nOSS facilitates extensive innovation in every sector. A recent\nfrom Harvard and the University of Toronto found that the total cost to produce the world’s OSS is $4.15 billion, while the value created is magnitudes larger: $8.8 trillion. It’s safe to say that many innovations of the digital age would not have been possible without OSS.\nWe must all work to ensure that OSS doesn’t fall victim to the tragedy of the commons. At CISA, we continue to emphasize that every software manufacturer should be a responsible consumer of the OSS that it uses, and that means also being a sustainable contributor back to the open source ecosystem. This same principle applies to open foundation models – everyone ought to do their part to ensure a safe, secure, and sustainable community.\nAdditionally, we have observed the benefits of open source tools in cybersecurity. While there has been a decades-long debate on the open sourcing of dual-use cybersecurity tools (i.e., tools that can both aid cyber defenders and be used maliciously by threat actors), the general consensus among the security community is that the benefits of open sourcing security tools for defenders outweigh the harms that might be leveraged by adversaries – who, in many cases, will get their hands on tools whether or not they are open sourced. While we cannot anticipate all the potential use cases of AI, lessons from cybersecurity history indicate that we can stand to benefit from dual-use open source tools.\nin recent years to help secure the OSS ecosystem. Our\nOpen Source Software Security Roadmap\n, published last year, starts with the recognition that open source software is supported by an inherently global community – and government’s role is to show up as a community member to support this community. We collaborated with the open source community to release\nprinciples for the security of package repositories\nthat five major package repositories – npm, PyPI, Crates.io, Composer, and Maven Central – are taking in line with this framework.\nThe AI community should heed these and other lessons from the open source community. Operators of package repositories in the AI ecosystem – such as platforms that distribute AI source code, models, weights, or training data – should work towards the items in the Principles for Package Repository Security framework and think about what unique considerations might apply. Tool developers should begin incorporating traceability and artifact composition analysis techniques. Model developers should include diverse viewpoints early and throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring that trust and safety is a core consideration during model development.\nPromote the responsible development and release of open foundation models while mitigating their potential harms\nIn our response, we define two sets of potential harms of foundation models. Our definitions are based on whether the deployer of the model – who is the entity that runs the model – intends for those harms to be caused, or if they seek to prevent them. The first class of harms are those deliberately sought by the deployer of the model, such as using the model to conduct cyberattacks or to generate non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII). The second class of harms are those which are not desired by the deployer of the model, such as a cybersecurity vulnerability in a model deployed by a critical infrastructure entity.\nThe first class of harms must be addressed with a multipronged risk reduction approach. This includes additional research and investment to limit abuse of the technology (which should draw on existing trust and safety work), although we know that many protections will inevitably be circumvented by malicious deployers. Therefore, domain-specific risk mitigations are also needed. For NCII, this might involve discouraging the training of specific capabilities in models that are widely distributed (such as by filtering training data) and societal approaches to support victims in abuse. For cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the best approach to all forms of threats – including those enabled by foundation models – is to ensure that software is built in a\nmanner resilient to the most common classes of vulnerabilities.\nMost of the conversation about open foundation models has been dominated by the abuse of such models by malicious deployers. We certainly should work to study and mitigate these harms. With that said, the second class of harms is equally deserving of attention; and, promisingly — as the deployer of these models does not want harms to occur — building protections against risks into models is more readily possible. For instance, the developer of an open source model could take a secure by design approach and build the model in a responsible manner, resilient to common classes of vulnerabilities. Such a developer could also train the model in a publicly verifiable way, or on publicly available data, thereby allowing others to more fully study the model’s behavior and gain confidence that it does not contain vulnerabilities or backdoors. Much as transparency strengthens the security of OSS, allowing for public study and verification can help secure open foundation models.\nWe recognize that today’s open foundation models exist along a spectrum of openness and applaud efforts to train open foundation models on appropriate public data. When a model’s weights and training code are published without disclosure of training data or pre-training, even though it may be modifiable by users in some ways, users of that model have only a limited ability to understand, verify, or mitigate any vulnerabilities in the model. This lack of transparency prevents inspection and research into how these models operate. Thus, developers of open weight foundation models without open data have a responsibility to ensure the outputs of their models are safe, secure, and trustworthy.\nCISA is committed to ensuring that OSS, including AI models, can continue to be deployed in a safe and secure manner to foster innovation.

      "content": "Continued Progress Towards a Secure Open Source Ecosystem\nBy: Aeva Black, Section Chief, Open Source Software Security\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn March of this year, CISA accelerated our work to secure open source software (OSS) by holding our first\nOpen Source Software Security Summit\n. The event gathered OSS leaders from across the community to learn from one another and to participate in a tabletop\ncentered on a joint response to a hypothetical vulnerability in critical OSS. We heard and\na lot of good work that's being done across the community and emphasized our approach as a facilitator for this important effort. A synchronized approach across the board will help drive security improvements and we have been busy in the months since that event to guide progress and document lessons learned.\nCISA’s latest efforts focus on\nOpen Source Software Security Roadmap\nDrive Visibility into OSS Usage and Risks”\n.  Achieving this goal will enable CISA and our partners across the federal government and critical infrastructure to manage cybersecurity risks more effectively and efficiently in the OSS that their missions substantially depend upon.\nThe task of assessing the trustworthiness of OSS that is in use, or that is being considered for use, is more complex for OSS than for proprietary software, because there is, generally speaking, no direct relationship between the authors of software and those who use that software. Whereas commercial software procurement creates a relationship between a purchaser and a supplier, in which the purchaser can ask for certain assurances of secure software development, the direct usage of OSS does not create a purchaser-supplier relationship. Even when mature open source software projects publish software bills of material or other artifacts of secure software development practices, it is the responsibility of those who use the project to perform the necessary diligence to continually assess each open source project, as discussed in CISA and partners’\nRecommended Practices for Managing Open Source Software\nThis effort to assess trustworthiness of OSS consists of two parts: creating a framework for measuring trust and scaling out its usage.\nCreating the Framework\nThe first task is to create a generally applicable framework for assessing the trustworthiness of any given OSS component. To do so, CISA is building upon an existing approach to evaluate the process by which OSS is developed across four dimensions: the project, the product, protection activities, and policies. Example measures within each category could include:\n: the number of active contributors, or unexpected changes in account ownership\n: the presence of known vulnerabilities or out-of-date dependencies\n: whether the project requires two-factor authentication on developer accounts\n: whether the project requires code review, or has a responsible vulnerability disclosure process\nMeasurements can be taken from a variety of data sources, including public data about OSS components such as metadata made available by package repositories and code hosting services. Taken together, the collected measurements can be grouped into these four categories to provide software users and choosers a consistent way to evaluate the trustworthiness of a particular OSS component.\nScaling Usage of the Framework\nThe second part of the effort is to automate the process of comparing components against the framework, while accounting for the subjectivity of each observer. While each software chooser could conceivably perform this evaluation manually, based on their unique evaluation criteria and operational requirements, tooling is necessary to make this process implementable and scalable. To make this possible, CISA is funding the development of\n, an open source tool to automate these measurements and to combine measurement results into a useful output.\nLeading collaboration and commitment\nAs work on both the framework and supporting tools continue to progress, we will improve our capability to assess OSS trustworthiness at scale, which in turn will benefit federal agencies, critical infrastructure, and the American public at large. We look forward to bringing members of the cybersecurity and open source communities together in the process of refining this work, so that it will have the largest possible impact.\nWe believe that a thriving open source ecosystem is a strong defense against a divided world—digital or otherwise. For all the benefits that collaborative development of OSS creates for society, there are those who seek to take advantage of these systems for nefarious purposes.\nBy committing to the principles of transparent and collaborative development of open source software, and prioritizing security considerations early and often, it will be substantially more difficult for malicious actors to succeed in exploiting OSS for nefarious purposes. It is by intentionally and proactively prioritizing security principles—like those espoused by\ncampaign—that actors will have a harder time creating exploitable divides in the first place.\nIf you would like to help, please send us an email at:\nOpenSource@cisa.dhs.gov\nFor more on our work on OSS Security, visit\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

From matrix games that can be played in a single morning or afternoon session, to one-day scenarios workshops that integrate multiple topics to highlight systems and emergent risks, the toolkit has activities targeted to different levels of participation and time commitment. The hope is that these activities lead to better insights on risk mitigation that participants can bring back to their organizations, while strengthening networks to engage in further planning and implementation.\nSecure Tomorrow Series Toolkit\nTo learn more, visit the\nSecure Tomorrow Series webpage\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nCISA Through the Years: Policy and Impact\nTarget Rich, Cyber Poor: Strengthening Our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors\nFrom Naturalization to Cyber Advocacy: CISA Region 3’s Chris Ramos Inspires New U.S. Citizens",

      "release_date": "2024-06-20T12:00:00Z",
      "content": "Why SMBs Don’t Deploy Single Sign On (SSO)\nBy: Dr. Olga Livingston, Senior Economist, and Bob Lord, Senior Technical Advisor\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn CISA’s Secure by Design whitepaper, we urge software manufacturers to consider how their business practices may inadvertently reduce the security posture of their customers. We recommend that essential security features should be available as part of the basic service offering. Consumers should not need to pay premium pricing, hidden surcharges, or additional fees for basic security hygiene. In particular, we mention that single sign-on capability should be available by default as part of the base offering—consumers should not need to bear an onerous “SSO tax” to get this necessary security measure.\nWhile it might seem reasonable to charge more for some features, this practice can hinder improvements in security posture by discouraging organizations from adopting a robust identity and access management (IAM) system. Organizations, including those below the security poverty line, deserve basic security hygiene. We argue that security should not be priced as a luxury good but instead should be considered a customer right.\nBut the SSO tax is not the only barrier to adoption of SSO by small and medium sized businesses (SMBs). Customers have differing perspectives about SSO.  Some SMBs see it as adding value that improves their security posture, while others do not believe the expense of SSO delivers significant operational improvement and commensurate returns. This latter view reflects the need for clear messaging on the advantages of SSO.  We wanted to learn more about the uptake of SSO at SMBs and began work on a report to shine a brighter light on this topic. We conducted focus groups with SMBs to learn how well they understood SSO and its benefits, hear about their user experience with implementing and maintaining SSO, and understand the barriers SMBs encountered in implementing an SSO program.\nThe report cites the following key findings:\nFirst, small enterprises often opt for manual passwords and hands-on approaches over an SSO option. These methods tend to have a reduced initial adoption cost, but this initial cost difference does not reflect the hidden administrative costs associated with maintaining manual passwords. A primary reason for the difference in the purchase cost for SSO is that SSO is often available only as a premium enterprise-level service. Such an enterprise service can cost significantly more per user than a lower-tier service that lacks SSO and typically requires a minimum number of users. These can be substantial barriers for many organizations.\nSecond, a lack of technical know-how and awareness poses another significant barrier to SSO adoption. Vendors feel confident that they offer sufficient training materials and how-to guides to support customers in effectively deploying SSO technology. However, customers have different perceptions and user experiences. Customers see SSO as a complex solution with numerous moving parts that may impede its successful deployment. These implementation challenges need to be addressed before customers consider adopting SSO.\nThird, customers have varying degrees of satisfaction with the accuracy and completeness of support materials and instructions. Even some of the more experienced and technically savvy users reported the need to submit numerous support tickets and engage in multiple interactions with their vendor’s customer support staff to fill gaps or resolve inaccuracies and omissions. For SMBs with limited resources, the opportunity cost of that time and the hassles with support materials make the pursuit of proper SSO implementation seem prohibitively expensive and result in a negative user experience.\nClearly there is work to be done not only on the economics aspects, but also on the user experience, the SSO service offering structure and product design, feature awareness, as well as requisite technical guidelines and instructions to properly implement and maintain SSO in order to increase adoption by SMBs. Manufacturers should recognize these unique challenges for their SMB customers and configure their settings to reduce operational friction and frustration. Doing so is in line with Secure by Design Principle 1: Take ownership of customer security outcomes. At the same time, CISA will continue to raise awareness about the benefits of SSO. Together we can meaningfully improve the security and safety of our nation.\nYou can find the report and accompanying fact sheet at\nBarriers to Single Sign-On (SSO) Adoption for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses: Identifying Challenges and Opportunities.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

      "author": "Jen Easterly, Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\n\n\n Related topics: \n\nCritical Infrastructure Security and Resilience \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 30th, the White House released National Security Memorandum-22 (NSM) on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, which updates national policy on how the U.S. government protects and secures critical infrastructure from cyber and all-hazard threats. NSM-22 recognizes the changed risk landscape over the past decade and leverages the enhanced authorities of federal departments and agencies to implement a new risk management cycle that prioritizes collaborating with partners to identify and mitigate sector, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk. The culmination of this cycle is the creation of the 2025 National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan (National Plan)—updating and replacing the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan—and will guide federal efforts to secure and protect critical infrastructure over the coming years. As the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will develop this National Plan to be forward-looking and employ all available federal tools, resources, and authorities to manage and reduce national-level risks, including those cascading across critical infrastructure sectors. CISA will look to its partners to help us and the other Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) over the course of the year as we develop this foundational document. The National Plan Must Account for the Evolution of Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Consequences Building off the priorities of NSM-22, the 2025 National Plan will articulate how the U.S. government will collaborate with partners to identify and manage national risk. This will be an evolution from the 2013 National Plan which described risk management as “the cornerstone” to strengthening critical infrastructure security and resilience. Eleven years later, the spirit of this concept holds true; yet it must evolve due to pervasive vulnerabilities and an elevated threat landscape, which could lead to cascading regional and national consequences. Fortunately, over that same decade, Congress and successive administrations have established new agencies, authorities, and collaborative partnerships that empower a whole-of-society approach to national risk management. As the National Coordinator, CISA will be the primary driver for operationalizing this approach through the National Plan. The National Plan will be Informed by a New Risk Management CycleNSM-22 details a new risk management cycle that requires SRMAs to identify, assess, and prioritize risk within their respective sectors and develop sector risk management plans to address those risks. With these risk assessments and risk management plans, CISA will identify and prioritize systemic, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk through a cross-sector risk assessment. This assessment will enable CISA to prioritize systemic risk reduction efforts—detailed in the National Plan—that the U.S. government will take in collaboration with relevant federal, state and local, private, and international partners. Most importantly, the National Plan will recognize that the U.S. government cannot make all critical infrastructure immune from all threats and hazards. Rather, it will detail U.S. government efforts to make critical infrastructure resilient against prioritized risks based on the 16 sector’s risk assessments and CISA’s cross-sector risk assessments. All the while, CISA and other federal partners will work closely with SRMAs to manage their unique sector risks.  We Need You for Us to be Successful This will be a fundamentally new approach to U.S. government risk management. In this era of technological advancements and dynamic global volatility, the security and resilience of our critical infrastructure are of paramount importance. Essential systems, including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, healthcare facilities, and communication systems, are vital for public safety, economic stability, and national security. The increasing interconnectivity of critical infrastructure systems, reliance upon global technologies and supply chains, and geopolitical tensions make these systems susceptible to a myriad of threats. Addressing these risks will require a coordinated national effort by federal agencies; State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments, infrastructure owners and operators, and other stakeholders across the critical infrastructure community. As those responsible for the security and resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure, we must collectively address emergent risks and an uncertain future while remaining vigilant against longstanding threats like terrorism, natural disasters, and targeted violence. Indeed, trusted, sustained, and effective partnerships between the federal government and private-sector and SLTT partners is the foundation of our collective effort to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure. Put simply, the 2025 National Plan will not succeed unless our partners collaborate with us to inform its development and its eventual implementation. We ask that you work with your respective SRMAs through the development of your sector risk assessments and sector risk management plans, as these will be core inputs into the National Plan. You can also contact us at sector.governance@cisa.dhs.gov for any of your ideas. These inputs will be invaluable as we develop a plan that allows the U.S. government to better prioritize our risk mitigation efforts and reduce risk for the critical infrastructure that underpin American society. For more information on the NSM-22 and CISA’s role as National Coordinator, visit CISA National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience | CISA.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 10, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nCISA Through the Years: Policy and Impact \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 07, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nTarget Rich, Cyber Poor: Strengthening Our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 19, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nFrom Naturalization to Cyber Advocacy: CISA Region 3’s Chris Ramos Inspires New U.S. Citizens\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

The winner of the 2024 Individuals Track A was U.S. Army Major Nolan Miles, and the winner of the 2024 Individuals Track B was Staff Sergeant Michael Torres from the U.S. Marine Corps.\n“The President’s Cup provides a unique opportunity to create a network of cyber professionals across government organizations, allowing these groups to compete for the best outcomes while simultaneously learning from and working alongside leaders across the government,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “The government must rise to the occasion and lead by example by rigorously training, competing, and innovating so that we are prepared to address the cyber-enabled threats that stand in front of us. This is why this program is so important.”\n“The President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition brings out the best in our Nation’s cyber workforce and today’s ceremony at the White House provided a fitting tribute to the talent, dedication and service of the men and women who work everyday to protect us in our increasingly digital world,” said\nWhite House National Cyber Director Harry Coker, Jr.\n“I’m proud to recognize, reward, and celebrate the accomplishments of our winners in this competition but I’m even prouder to acknowledge their service to the Nation. Their work is vital, their service is appreciated, and we – as a Nation – are all better, safer, and stronger because of their efforts.”\nThe President’s Cup is led and hosted by CISA and presents competitors with a series of challenges designed around the\nNational Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework Work Roles\nto identify, recognize, and reward the best cybersecurity talent across the federal workforce.\nCISA developed this interactive competition to invest in the professional development of federal employees and bring awareness to having skilled talent in cybersecurity careers.\nThis year’s competition provided a unique training opportunity that included an interactive story-based video game featuring a series of challenges aligned to the NICE Framework Work roles to enhance and embrace participants’ skills as they outwit and outthink their competitors.\nAnother new element to the competition was the ICScape Room, an immersive, hands-on experience that provided challengers with a realistic and relatable scenario, compelling them to apply their expertise, teamwork, and collaboration skills to achieve optimal solutions.\nThe President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition is open to the federal civilian workforce and members of the military. Watch videos from the 2024 and previous competitions and learn more information about the annual event at\nPresident's Cup Cybersecurity Competition\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

While some actors remain financially motivated, others such as nation-state actors aligned with the People’s Republic of China, aim to compromise U.S. critical infrastructure networks to potentially disrupt critical services in the event of a geopolitical conflict. Organizations need to be prepared to respond and remain resilient in the face of these challenging threats, and exercises, such as Cyber Storm, serve as a critical tool to enhance preparedness. A few weeks ago, approximately one hundred exercise planners convened at CISA headquarters for the ninth iteration of the national cyber exercise, Cyber Storm. The planners, representing private industry, federal, state, and international government partners, managed an exercise that spanned across the globe to simulate a coordinated cyberattack targeting critical infrastructure. What sets Cyber Storm apart from other cyber exercises is the depth and breadth of the exercise.  We hosted over 2,200 participants from 300 organizations from more than 80 private sector companies, 35 federal departments and agencies, 11 states, and nine partner countries. It provided an immersive experience for participants to engage in all aspects of cyber incident response through three days of live exercise play. The exercise scenario centered on adversary exploitation of common misconfigurations of cloud environments to cause various impacts to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Initial impacts occurred within the Food and Agriculture Sector but ultimately impacted many organizations across multiple sectors.Our planners enhanced the realism of the exercise through simulating traditional and social media websites, as well as creating a simulated dark web. Additionally, Cyber Storm IX simulated enemies who employed tactics, techniques, and procedures used by real-world adversaries.  The simulated threat actors had an agenda with sufficient resources to carry out the attacks to meet the exercise’s objectives.Cyber Storm gave the participants an opportunity to exercise organizational response plans and capabilities, foster relationships with counterparts, and improve organizational and national cyber readiness and resilience. Participating organizations worked directly with CISA and coordinating bodies such as Sector Risk Management Agencies and Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to understand roles and capabilities during a cyberattack.  Outcomes from Cyber Storm IX will be published later this year at Cyber Storm: Securing Cyber Space | CISA. CISA will continue to assist stakeholders with end-to-end exercise development support upon request to increase resilience to both physical and cyber threats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

Additionally, Cyber Storm IX simulated enemies who employed tactics, techniques, and procedures used by real-world adversaries.  The simulated threat actors had an agenda with sufficient resources to carry out the attacks to meet the exercise’s objectives.\nCyber Storm gave the participants an opportunity to exercise organizational response plans and capabilities, foster relationships with counterparts, and improve organizational and national cyber readiness and resilience. Participating organizations worked directly with CISA and coordinating bodies such as Sector Risk Management Agencies and Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to understand roles and capabilities during a cyberattack.\nOutcomes from Cyber Storm IX will be published later this year at\nCyber Storm: Securing Cyber Space | CISA\n. CISA will continue to assist stakeholders with end-to-end exercise development support upon\nto increase resilience to both physical and cyber threats.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

Among the attendees were state 911 administrators, representatives from 911 centers, IT/cyber communities at the state and local levels, and Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWICs) from each state. The symposium fostered collaboration with various internal CISA resources, including Cybersecurity Advisors (CSAs) and Emergency Communication Coordinators (ECCs) representing specific states within each CISA region.\nThis symposium highlights the pivotal role emergency communications play in safeguarding our communities, emphasizing the imperative of establishing resilient systems and fostering collaboration. Building on this collaboration is crucial for enhancing nationwide interoperability and strengthening stakeholder relationships, especially in emergency communication systems like 911. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) continue to partner with CISA to engage stakeholders to determine cybersecurity priorities for the CR911 Program.\nAt the symposium, speakers and panelists presented an overview of the current cyber threat landscape and shared resources to help enhance the cybersecurity posture of Emergency Communication Centers. Symposium topics included the current state of cyber resilience in the 911 ecosystem, best practices for responding to a cyberattack, including an overview of lessons learned from the Bucks County, Pennsylvania, cyberattack, and the available cybersecurity resources for each region. CISA facilitators used interactive live polling, breakout sessions and group discussions to gather stakeholders’ current needs, concerns, and capability gaps about cybersecurity. Attendees also participated in a tabletop discussion focused on a simulated cyberattack scenario.\nBilly Bob Brown, Jr., Executive Assistant Director for CISA’s ECD, reflected on the culmination of the program’s fourth symposium. “We've been privileged to host four successful symposiums across the United States, bringing together diverse 911 teams to deliberate on cyber resilience and chart a course towards a secure 911 ecosystem. Our collaborative efforts have been instrumental in learning from our partners and tailoring a CR911 Program that addresses the community's needs, identifies gaps, and incorporates invaluable input. From the Northeast to the Southeast, and through the Central and Western Regions, our engagements with 911 stakeholders and federal partners, including the FCC, NHTSA, and NTIA, have enriched our understanding of regional challenges and perspectives.

      "content": "Opening Statement by CISA Director Jen Easterly at the Update on Foreign Threats to the 2024 Elections Hearing\nJen Easterly, CISA Director\nChairman, Vice Chairman, members of the Committee, thanks for the opportunity to discuss CISA’s work to protect and defend our nation’s election infrastructure.\nSince 2017 when election infrastructure was designated as critical infrastructure and CISA designated as the Sector Risk Management Agency for election infrastructure, CISA and our partners across the federal government, including the IC and the FBI, have made significant progress increasing the security and the resilience of our Nation’s elections, working to support state and local election officials who serve on the frontlines of our democracy, administering, managing, and securing our elections. Election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger.\nAs a result, these officials ran secure federal elections in 2018, 2020, and 2022. As you know, there is no evidence that malicious actors changed, altered, or deleted votes or had any impact on the outcome of these elections. This has been validated time and again, including in multiple court challenges. And in the states where the 2020 Presidential election was close, officials had paper records that were used to count, recount, or audit to ensure accuracy. In this role, I’ve had the privilege to spend time with Chief Election Officials across the country of both parties and witness how tirelessly they work to ensure that their citizens’ votes are counted as cast. It’s why I have confidence in the integrity of our elections, and why the American people should as well.\nHowever, we cannot be complacent. While our election infrastructure is more secure than ever, today’s threat environment is more complex than ever. And we are very clear eyed about this. As the DNI noted, our foreign adversaries remain a persistent threat to our elections, intent on undermining Americans’ confidence in the foundation of our democracy and sowing partisan discord, efforts which could be exacerbated by generative AI capabilities. Perhaps even more concerning, however, is the continuing physical threats toward election officials, largely stemming from unfounded claims that the 2020 election did not represent the will of the people.\nSuch claims are corrosive to our most sacred of democratic traditions and have led to harassment and threats of violence against election officials of both parties and their families. As a result, we’ve seen a wave of departures of election officials, taking with them extensive experience and critical institutional knowledge. Many who remain are forced to carry out their work under difficult circumstances. We at CISA are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with these election heroes defending the very foundation of our democracy.\nIn fact, CISA is providing more services in more jurisdictions than ever before, with extensive guidance and training featured on our Protect 2024 website. Since the beginning of 2023, we’ve conducted over 340 cybersecurity assessments; 520 physical security assessments; 70 tabletop exercises; and provided over 220 trainings reaching more than 9,000 participants. We provide weekly reports to nearly 1,000 election infrastructure stakeholders, highlighting vulnerabilities so they can be quickly remediated. We’ve sponsored more than 230 security clearances to election officials and worked with the IC to set up classified briefings on nation state threats. And most recently, we hired 10 dedicated regional Election Security Advisors who bring over 210 years of election experience to support election stakeholders across the nation.\nFinally, we continue to actively engage on threats posed by foreign malign influence operations, providing updated guidance, as recent as last month, on the tactics of disinformation being deployed by our adversaries; we’re using our\nwebsite to provide accurate information about election infrastructure security; and most importantly, we’re amplifying the voices of state and local election officials who are the authoritative subject matter experts when it comes to elections.\nAs these officials know, elections are political, but election security is not. We at CISA are committed to keeping it that way and look to your leadership and support in helping us do so.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nThe referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.\nDefending Democracy: The #PROTECT2024 Chapter in Election Infrastructure Security\nA Message to Election Officials from CISA Director Jen Easterly\nCISA Director Jen Easterly Remarks at the Election Center 39th Annual National Conference in Detroit\nRegion 10 Team Provides Vital Election Security Training for Idaho",

It also strongly encourages software manufactures to actively implement and publicly commit to Secure by Design practices that are necessary to help protect vulnerable and high-risk communities.\nThe guide provides recommended mitigations for civil society organizations, which include implementing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA), using caution when sharing information on social media, prioritizing vendors that align their practices to Secure by Design principles, and ensuring awareness of social engineering tactics.\n“State-sponsored actors seek to undermine fundamental democratic and humanitarian values and interests supported by civil society organizations and individuals. However, these high-risk community organizations often lack cyber threat information and security resources,” said\nJen Easterly Director CISA\n. “With our federal and international partners, we are providing this resource to help these organizations better understand the cyber threats they face and help them improve their cyber safety.”\n\"The FBI and its partners are putting out this guidance so that civil society organizations have the capacity to mitigate the threats that they face in the cyber realm,” said\nAssistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division\n. “We’d like to help these entities, whether they are nonprofits, think tanks, or groups working to defend human rights and advance democracy, defend themselves against malicious state-sponsored actors looking to exploit them.”\n“We thank CISA and partners for close cooperation on releasing this guidance. It was confirmed in Japan that organizations and individuals such as academia, think tanks and journalists have been targeted by cyberattacks.,” said\nMr. Atsuo Suzuki, Director General, Japan National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity\n(NISC). “We would like to partner with co-sealing countries and organizations of this guidance to make contribution to enhancing cybersecurity.”\n“Last couple of years have shown that every organisation can be targeted with malicious cyber activities. The root of this problem lies typically in lack of knowledge about cyber threats, or cyber threaths not taken as seriously as they should be. It is important to raise awareness and provide guidelines, such as the freshly published guidance for civil society organisations and individuals. I invite all organisations to make good use of the guide and to learn how to take the necessary steps to protect yourself from cyber threats,“ said\nGert Auväärt, Director of Cyber Security of the Estonian State Information Authority\n“The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, a part of CSE, welcomes this report. The best way to protect Canada and our global partners from the growing threat of foreign interference, and digital transnational repression is to raise awareness about the threat,” said\nSami Khoury, Head, Canadian Centre for Cyber Security\n. “We all have a role to play in defending our democratic institutions, including our civil society organizations and individuals.”\n“Civil society groups play a crucial role in upholding our democratic values in the UK and around the world and so it is vital they have the information they need to protect themselves online,” said\nFelicity Oswald, Chief Executive of the United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre\n. “This new guidance, developed with international partners, will help those with limited resources ensure they have strong security measures in place to manage the greater risk of targeting that they face. We are committed to our ongoing collaboration with likeminded countries to raise the collective resilience of global democracy and safeguard civil society from cyber threats.”\n\"Preparing for global cyber threats requires national and international cooperation. This report is an excellent example of confidential cooperation with our international partners. This guide also supports our work to improve cyber security awareness in Finland,\" says\nAnssi Kärkkäinen, deputy director general of National Cyber Security Centre Finland\nMalicious state-sponsored actors use various tactics to gain initial access and then often install spyware on the compromised devices to conduct more extensive surveillance, such as location tracking and access to files. The guide provides a list of state-sponsored actors known to target civil society organizations primarily from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, along with an overview of their known tactics and techniques. The overview helps organizations better understand the adversarial behavior so their leadership can make informed resourcing decisions on basic cybersecurity controls.\nIn addition to CISA, partnering agencies include:\nDepartment of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS I&A),\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), Estonian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-EE), National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) Japan, National Police Agency (NPA) Japan, Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC), National Cyber Security Centre – Finland (NCSC-FI), and United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK).\nFor more information, see CISA’s\nCybersecurity Resources for High-Risk Communities\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

      "title": "Categorically Unsafe Software",
      "url": "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/categorically-unsafe-software",
      "author": "looking at trends, we can start to see which software companies are making progress and which need to initiate a quality improvement program. Generalizing remedies. By thinking about classes of defect, we can think beyond the symptom of the problem, and start to reason more about ways to generalize remedies. This line of thinking also serves to shift the responsibility of security from the least capable to the most equipped. Instead of software developers asking, “How can I fix this one defect?” they can ask “How can I prevent all similar defects?” Rather than fixing one SQL injection (SQLi) defect, why not eliminate them entirely, as some companies appear to have done? Remediation scale. Some classes of coding error can be eliminated with relatively low effort, while some may require significant effort. Until we learn how widespread various classes of defect are, we won’t be able to distinguish between classes of defect that companies should eliminate on their own, and those that require a coordinated effort by the larger software ecosystem.Shift left. In the context of software development, people use the phrase “shift left” to mean conducting certain activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Part of the idea is that preventing coding mistakes is cheaper than catching and fixing them later in the timeline. The phrases “shift left” and “eliminating classes of vulnerability” are different sides of the same coin. If you truly align your product security program to prevent defects as early in the development cycle as possible, meaning that you are shifting security left on a timeline, you must contemplate ways to eliminate entire classes of coding error.Developer ecosystems. Google’s March 2024 whitepaper titled “Secure by Design at Google” includes this important observation: “The security posture of software products and services is an emergent property of the developer ecosystem in which they are designed, implemented and deployed”. They further write that “careful design of developer ecosystems can drastically lower the incidence of certain kinds of defects, and in some cases practically eliminate them”. The idea is that repeated types of software defects are not the fault of the individual software developer. That means that “developer training” might not be the best remedy. Instead, they argue, those repeat offender defects are an emergent property of the tools and practices that the company has given their coders. Some tools make it nearly impossible for the developer to avoid coding errors. As one example, see the prevalence of memory safety defects in languages like C/C++ compared to others like Swift, C#, Java, Rust, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Ruby. CostsReducing costs to software manufacturers. Software defects can be reported at random times. Pulling software developers off other tasks to address software defects can be expensive and disruptive to project schedules. As any business looks to save where it can, it is useful to examine the costs of insecurity to the company. To instead achieve economies of scale, companies should invest in the tools and resources needed to prevent the introduction of entire classes of defect and achieve secure outcomes like secure developer ecosystems.Reducing costs to the customers. Applying software updates is not a trivial matter in businesses, small or large – not to mention the costs of an intrusion. We now know that security will not be achieved by simply “patching harder.” Therefore, reducing the number of critical security fixes can reduce the load on IT professionals, and improve customer security.Increasing costs to the threat actors. When we eliminate entire classes of defect, we make it harder for threat actors to exploit simple vulnerabilities. That raises their cost to conduct malicious cyber activity. If product teams eliminate enough of the classic defects, they may price some threat actors out of the market. Aren’t we doing that already?Some software companies are already working to eliminate classes of coding error. Some have even accomplished that goal for the most common classes. But there is evidence that the industry as a whole is not making sufficient progress. In fact, many top software products fail to protect their customers from exploitation of the most common classes of defect. We read in the news about these common defects causing significant damage to companies and government agencies.Let’s compare two documents, MITRE’s 2007 paper titled, “Unforgivable Vulnerabilities”, and their 2023 analysis of “Stubborn Weaknesses”. It would be a reasonable hope that the classes of defect from 2007 would have been eliminated and that the 2023 report would have all new classes of defect that are more expensive to exploit. We would hope that the software industry would eliminate top classes of defect every few years because doing so would increase the cost to threat actors.Sadly, the truth is that the software industry has made inadequate progress since 2007, the year the iPhone was introduced. Of the 13 “unforgivable vulnerabilities”, most are still present in the 2023 report in one form or another. We are still plagued by classes of defect like memory unsafety, XSS, SQL injection, directory traversal, and improper input sanitization. What’s especially noteworthy is that for most of these classes of defect, we have known of ways to prevent them at scale for years, and even decades. Some damaging and costly cyber intrusions were likely preventable.Over the past 17+ years, many software companies have prioritized fixing software defects found in customer deployments over fixing them in their product designs, thereby putting customers at risk and leading to significant real-world harms.The CWE/CPE challengeThe above two reports rely on the Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) program, and in particular, CVE Numbering Authorities’ (CNA) commitment to provide timely, complete, and correct CVE records. Especially important to root cause analysis are the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) fields. The CWE explains the type of coding error that created the defect. The CPE provides information about product and platform naming. Today, some CNAs ensure CWE and CPE fields are included with all CVE records they create, but many are not as diligent. Until all CNAs and software manufacturers fully commit themselves to ensuring that their CVE records (and CWE/CPE fields) are timely, complete, and correct, we will struggle to become a data-driven industry. Incomplete or inaccurate data will keep us in the dark about the root causes of cyber intrusions and inhibit our ability to prevent them at scale. But we’re seeing signs of progress. Recently Microsoft announced that they would “now publish root cause data for Microsoft CVEs using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) industry standard”. Their blog post is worth reading to understand their perspective. This development — and the commitment of 68 software manufacturers as part of our pledge to do the same — is exciting, and we hope all CNAs and software manufacturers follow suit. ConclusionThe next time you see a security-sensitive update for a software product, don’t focus on how the threat actors are abusing that specific coding error. Ask yourself what class of coding error it belongs to. If it belongs to one of the “unforgivable vulnerabilities” from the 2007 paper, or one of the recurring “stubborn weaknesses”, ask yourself why the software manufacturer shipped the product with that defect when systemic preventions are well-known. More importantly, ask those software companies what they are doing to eliminate that entire class of defect. As customers, we should demand that companies stop the practice of shipping defective software, and then only fixing the problems that are found in the field, often after a customer has been injured. The bottom line is that a secure by design software development program necessitates formal efforts to eliminate entire classes of defect before the product ships rather than playing whack-a-mole with defects that appear on customer systems in production. For the software manufacturer, a secure by design program that works to eliminate entire classes of defect is likely to be cheaper in the long run and will create a higher quality product that requires fewer emergency fixes. Such a program should be part of the company’s business strategy. For the customers, it will reduce the burden of having to apply as many urgent software updates. For our country, it will result in greater security and safety. It is the norm in other industries to perform root cause analysis and to work towards eliminating classes of defect and it is long past time for it to be the norm in the software industry.For more information on developing software that is secure by design, please see CISA’s Secure by Design whitepaper. We encourage all software manufacturers to demonstrate their commitment by taking CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

      "content": "Categorically Unsafe Software\nTIME TO CLASS UP THE JOINT!\nBy: Senior Technical Advisors Bob Lord and Jack Cable, Senior Advisor Lauren Zabierek\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn many of our writings about the secure by design initiative, we use phrases like “classes of coding error”, “classes of vulnerability”, or “categories of defect”. You may wonder why we place so much emphasis on grouping defects together rather than focusing on individual ones. In fact, we’ve had many people ask us why we urge software manufacturers to\neliminate entire classes\nof defect like cross-site scripting (XSS),\nSecure by Design Pledge\n. To illustrate how focusing on quality and eliminating groups of errors improves security, we offer our current thinking.\nFrom patterns to progress\nCopying successful industries\n. While it might seem like a novel concept to making software more secure, root cause analysis and mitigation of repeated classes of defect is the norm in industries that have significantly higher levels of quality and safety. In the aviation industry, experts analyze safety-related incidents to understand not just the proximate causes of the problem, but the multiple contributing factors, thereby allowing them to make recommendations to change pilot, crew, and air traffic controller training, plane maintenance, and cockpit and aircraft design, among others.\n. To improve product quality and security at scale, we need to spot patterns of recurring defect so that we can move from addressing each defect one at a time to eliminating them from the start. What kinds of coding errors do developers repeatedly make at any given software manufacturer, or across the industry? When we group negative outcomes into classes, we can start to engage in systems thinking to understand the real root causes and potential remedies. Moreover, this helps us to better predict how these product defects will be exploited by malicious actors, thereby giving defenders a leg up when leveraging limited resources.\nAnalyzing trends over time\n. Pattern detection is just the first step. We also need to understand how those patterns change over time. Are classes of defect increasing or decreasing over time for any given software product, or across the entire industry? By looking at trends, we can start to see which software companies are making progress and which need to initiate a quality improvement program.\nGeneralizing remedies\n. By thinking about classes of defect, we can think beyond the symptom of the problem, and start to reason more about ways to generalize remedies. This line of thinking also serves to shift the responsibility of security from the least capable to the most equipped. Instead of software developers asking, “How can I fix this one defect?” they can ask “How can I prevent all similar defects?” Rather than fixing one SQL injection (SQLi) defect, why not eliminate them entirely, as some companies appear to have done?\n. Some classes of coding error can be eliminated with relatively low effort, while some may require significant effort. Until we learn how widespread various classes of defect are, we won’t be able to distinguish between classes of defect that companies should eliminate on their own, and those that require a coordinated effort by the larger software ecosystem.\n. In the context of software development, people use the phrase “shift left” to mean conducting certain activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Part of the idea is that preventing coding mistakes is cheaper than catching and fixing them later in the timeline. The phrases “shift left” and “eliminating classes of vulnerability” are different sides of the same coin. If you truly align your product security program to prevent defects as early in the development cycle as possible, meaning that you are shifting security left on a timeline, you must contemplate ways to eliminate entire classes of coding error.\n. Google’s March 2024 whitepaper titled “\nSecure by Design at Google\n” includes this important observation: “The security posture of software products and services is an\nof the developer ecosystem in which they are designed, implemented and deployed”. They further write that “careful design of developer ecosystems can drastically lower the incidence of certain kinds of defects, and in some cases practically eliminate them”. The idea is that repeated types of software defects are not the fault of the individual software developer. That means that “developer training” might not be the best remedy. Instead, they argue, those repeat offender defects are an\nof the tools and practices that the company has given their coders. Some tools make it nearly impossible for the developer to avoid coding errors. As one example, see the prevalence of memory safety defects in languages like C/C++ compared to others like Swift, C#, Java, Rust, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Ruby.\nReducing costs to software manufacturers\n. Software defects can be reported at random times. Pulling software developers off other tasks to address software defects can be expensive and disruptive to project schedules. As any business looks to save where it can, it is useful to examine the costs of insecurity to the company. To instead achieve economies of scale, companies should invest in the tools and resources needed to prevent the introduction of entire classes of defect and achieve secure outcomes like secure developer ecosystems.\nReducing costs to the customers\n. Applying software updates is not a trivial matter in businesses, small or large – not to mention the costs of an intrusion. We now know that security will not be achieved by simply “patching harder.” Therefore, reducing the number of critical security fixes can reduce the load on IT professionals, and improve customer security.\nIncreasing costs to the threat actors\n. When we eliminate entire classes of defect, we make it harder for threat actors to exploit simple vulnerabilities. That raises their cost to conduct malicious cyber activity. If product teams eliminate enough of the classic defects, they may price some\nAren’t we doing that already?\nSome software companies are already working to eliminate classes of coding error. Some have even accomplished that goal for the most common classes. But there is evidence that the industry as a whole is not making sufficient progress. In fact, many top software products fail to protect their customers from exploitation of the most common classes of defect. We read in the news about these common defects causing significant damage to companies and government agencies.\nLet’s compare two documents, MITRE’s 2007 paper titled, “\nUnforgivable Vulnerabilities\n”, and their 2023 analysis of “\n”. It would be a reasonable hope that the classes of defect from 2007 would have been eliminated and that the 2023 report would have all new classes of defect that are more expensive to exploit. We would hope that the software industry would eliminate top classes of defect every few years because doing so would increase the cost to threat actors.\nSadly, the truth is that the software industry has made inadequate progress since 2007, the year the iPhone was introduced. Of the 13 “unforgivable vulnerabilities”, most are still present in the 2023 report in one form or another. We are still plagued by classes of defect like memory unsafety, XSS, SQL injection, directory traversal, and improper input sanitization.\nWhat’s especially noteworthy is that for most of these classes of defect, we have known of ways to prevent them at scale for years, and even decades\n. Some damaging and costly cyber intrusions were likely preventable.\nOver the past 17+ years, many software companies have prioritized fixing software defects found in customer deployments over fixing them in their product designs, thereby putting customers at risk and leading to significant real-world harms.\nThe CWE/CPE challenge\nThe above two reports rely on the\nCommon Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE)\nprogram, and in particular, CVE Numbering Authorities’ (CNA) commitment to provide timely, complete, and correct CVE records. Especially important to root cause analysis are the\nCommon Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\nCommon Platform Enumeration (CPE)\nfields. The CWE explains the type of coding error that created the defect. The CPE provides information about product and platform naming.\nToday, some CNAs ensure CWE and CPE fields are included with all CVE records they create, but many are not as diligent. Until all CNAs and software manufacturers fully commit themselves to ensuring that their CVE records (and CWE/CPE fields) are timely, complete, and correct, we will struggle to become a data-driven industry. Incomplete or inaccurate data will keep us in the dark about the root causes of cyber intrusions and inhibit our ability to prevent them at scale.\nBut we’re seeing signs of progress. Recently\nthat they would “now publish root cause data for Microsoft CVEs using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) industry standard”. Their blog post is worth reading to understand their perspective. This development — and the commitment of 68 software manufacturers as part of our\nto do the same — is exciting, and we hope all CNAs and software manufacturers follow suit.\nThe next time you see a security-sensitive update for a software product, don’t focus on how the threat actors are abusing that specific coding error. Ask yourself what class of coding error it belongs to. If it belongs to one of the “unforgivable vulnerabilities” from the 2007 paper, or one of the recurring “stubborn weaknesses”, ask yourself why the software manufacturer shipped the product with that defect when systemic preventions are well-known. More importantly, ask those software companies what they are doing to eliminate that entire class of defect. As customers, we should demand that companies stop the practice of shipping defective software, and then only fixing the problems that are found in the field, often after a customer has been injured.\nThe bottom line is that a secure by design software development program necessitates formal efforts to eliminate entire classes of defect before the product ships rather than playing whack-a-mole with defects that appear on customer systems in production. For the software manufacturer, a secure by design program that works to eliminate entire classes of defect is likely to be cheaper in the long run and will create a higher quality product that requires fewer emergency fixes. Such a program should be part of the company’s business strategy. For the customers, it will reduce the burden of having to apply as many urgent software updates. For our country, it will result in greater security and safety. It is the norm in other industries to perform root cause analysis and to work towards eliminating classes of defect and it is long past time for it to be the norm in the software industry.\nFor more information on developing software that is\nCISA’s Secure by Design whitepaper\n.

      "content": "The Top Four Things Tech Manufacturers can do to Bolster the Cybersecurity of Target-Rich, Cyber-Poor Organizations\nBy:  Clayton Romans, Associate Director and Emily Skahill, Cyber Operations Planner\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nSchools, municipalities, and non-profit organizations contribute to flourishing communities by supporting civic life and democratic processes.\nUnfortunately, many of these “target-rich, cyber-poor” organizations find themselves susceptible to cyber intrusions by cybercriminals and advanced persistent threat actors because they lack the resources to adequately invest in cybersecurity talent, tools, and services. This can lead to the disruption of critical social services supporting civil society and put the information of vulnerable communities at risk of theft and/or ransom.\nBecause many software manufacturers have not built their products in a secure by design manner, “target rich, cyber-poor” organizations are at a disadvantage. In many cases, they need someone with training and expertise to implement mitigations and securely configure products– a resource they can’t always afford. To make true progress in securing the organizations that lead to flourishing communities, technology manufacturers should keep the context and constraints of these end users in mind and ensure that organizations with varying levels of resources and technical expertise can deploy products securely.\nFor product offerings that are heavily used by schools, municipalities, non-profits, and other “target-rich, cyber-poor” organizations, here are some general facts to keep in mind:\nThe organization may not have a dedicated full-time Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or even an Information Technology (IT) Director. Therefore, products should be securely configured out of the box so that the burden isn’t on non-IT personnel to implement configurations correctly.\nWhen serving K-12 institutions, you are serving an organization with users (who may have logins and passwords) that are just learning their ABCs. This should be reflected so that anyone can use a product securely without needing to be a cybersecurity expert.\nThe Board of Directors or Council are often part-time volunteers who may have minimum reimbursement and often have other full-time jobs. Security is often not their primary focus or motivator.\nIT budgets and allocations for cybersecurity are often limited.\nUsing this context as a guiding principle, the following four steps can guide software manufacturers to bolster the digital defenses of “target-rich, cyber-poor” organizations.\nCISA’s Secure by Design pledge\nto commit to building products that have security from the start and available out of the box.\nLaunched this week, CISA’s Secure by Design pledge is catalyzing actions by leading technology manufacturers to take ownership of security outcomes for customers.\nCISA’s Secure by Design whitepaper\nfor more information on what it means to be secure by design.\nMake it easy to use technology products securely for users of all skill level.\nNot every organization has a dedicated full-time CISO, IT Director, or even a team member with the technical background to understand a product’s security controls and their impact on the organization’s digital ecosystem.\nIndustry should include a Customer Responsibility Matrix and simplified instructions as part of a product offering and implementation. For example, this is a requirement in StateRAMP’s\nfor StateRAMP Ready and StateRAMP Authorization, as security relies on shared responsibilities.\nIdeally, end users shouldn’t need to take any steps to use a product securely. Consider reviewing hardening guides to lift the burden from users by making secure configurations the default.\nContribute time and technical expertise to programs that support the cyber readiness of schools, municipalities, and non-profits.\nIndustry subject matter experts can advise under-resourced organizations on cybersecurity best practices through participation in cyber volunteer programs.\nCyber Volunteer Resource Center\nfor more information on how to lend support to local and international cyber volunteer programs.\nIndustry can also participate in programs, such as\n, Multi-State-Information Sharing and Analysis Center,\n, and others that provide shared resources to state, local, educational, and non-profit organizations.\nDevelop a program that offers tools or services to “target-rich, cyber-poor” organizations for free or at a discounted rate.\nFree Cybersecurity Services & Tools\nand help to grow this collection of cybersecurity resources for under-resourced communities that play a vital role in civic life.\nBy taking these four steps to consider the cybersecurity challenges of “target-rich, cyber-poor organizations” and empower them to deploy products that are secure by design and default, industry can help raise the cybersecurity baseline of the organizations that promote flourishing communities.\nNetHope and StateRAMP contributed to this blog.\nCISA does not endorse any commercial entity, product, company, or service, including any entities, products, or services referenced or linked to on this page.

      "content": "CISA Unveils New Public Service Announcement – We Can Secure Our World\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nWASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is pleased to launch\nWe Can Secure Our World\n, the second PSA in its\ncybersecurity public awareness program. The PSA will be promoted widely across the U.S. on television, radio, digital ads, retail centers, social media platforms, and billboards throughout 2024.\nWe Can Secure Our World\nbuilds on the success of CISA’s first ever public service announcement (PSA) which launched in September 2023.\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted last year shows that 95% of American adults use the internet, 90% have a smartphone and 80% subscribe to high-speed internet at home. Additionally, the survey also reported nearly 70% of children and adolescents have been exposed to at least one cyber risk in the past year. With cyber threats increasing among Americans of all ages, CISA is working to empower all Americans to protect themselves from hackers getting into their devices through easy steps that anyone can do anywhere and anytime.\nThe Secure Our World cybersecurity public awareness program, initially launched in September 2023, with its first PSA receiving nearly 20,000 views on YouTube, and educational materials including “How to” videos and tip sheets, were downloaded approximately 50,000 times. CISA also had a video that aired at the NFL Experience in the week leading up to the Super Bowl. CISA had a Super Bowl-related social media campaign that garnered more than 200,000 views and reached audiences spanning America’s diverse population.\nThe Secure Our World program is designed to educate and empower individuals to take proactive steps in safeguarding their digital lives. Tapping into the nostalgia of beloved musical cartoon series from the 1970s and 1980s, the new PSA features lovable character Max from the first PSA and introduces “\n” who teaches us how to stay safe online. Through engaging messaging encouraging simple steps to protect ourselves online, the program aims to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and empower individuals to adopt best practices to mitigate online risks.\n“Basic cyber hygiene prevents 98% of cyber attacks—why we’re on a mission to make cyber hygiene as common as brushing our teeth and washing our hands. BUT(!) “cyber” anything can seem overly technical and complicated to the vast majority of Americans from K through Gray—why we’re also on a mission to make such information more accessible,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “As someone who grew up with Saturday morning cartoons, I am super excited about what we’ve done with our new Secure Our World PSA to leverage a recognizable educational medium to promote cybersecurity best practices. We’re really excited to take public awareness of cyber safety to a whole new level of creativity.”\nWe encourage organizations large and small to join forces with CISA today to bolster cybersecurity awareness, empower individuals to take action, and drive adoption of critical behaviors, Together, let’s champion the cybersecurity basics: encourage the use of strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, recognize and report phishing attempts, and prioritize software updates. Our collaboration can have a far-reaching effect to protect individuals, businesses and critical infrastructure from cyber threats, promoting trust, resilience and security in the digital realm.\nWe Can Secure Our World PSA\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

According to the latest annual report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, “China remains the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. Government, private sector, and critical infrastructure networks.” Recently, CISA and our U.S. Government partners have seen a troubling shift: PRC nation-state cyber actors are setting their sights on U.S. critical infrastructure with an eye toward future disruption.\nWe are deeply concerned that the PRC is seeking the ability to disrupt the critical services that support the American people in the event of a geopolitical crisis or conflict, marking an alarming evolution in their tactics. Many critical infrastructure owners and operators either are small businesses themselves or rely on small business service providers and vendors to support their operations. This critical infrastructure is vital to ensuring the American people can rely on essential services, from water to energy, every hour of every day. The PRC aims to infiltrate those networks now in order to be ready to disrupt and degrade services at a later date, which makes the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure and small businesses a national security priority.\nThese threats are not theoretical; CISA teams have found and eradicated Chinese intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors, including aviation, energy, water and telecommunications. Through our\n, CISA knows that many small and medium-sized business (SMB) owners, including those operating in these sectors, are prime targets for PRC nation-state cyber actors. Some of these victims have limited cybersecurity capabilities and provide critical services to larger organizations or key geographic locations. And what we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg.\nWhile the scale of the PRC cyber threat can seem overwhelming, there are actionable steps that SMBs can take to manage the potential risks.\nReport Every Cyber Incident\n. Every victim of a cyber incident should promptly\nit to CISA, every time. We use this information to build a common understanding of how our adversaries are targeting U.S. networks and critical infrastructure. Cyber incident reporting helps us fill critical information gaps and allows us to rapidly deploy resources and help victims suffering attacks, analyze incoming reporting across sectors to spot trends, and quickly share that information with network defenders to warn other potential victims. Reporting cyber incidents quickly and effectively may reduce harm and help expedite recovery for the victim.\nEngage with CISA Proactively\n. CISA offers a range of cyber and physical services across our 10 regions. We recommend every critical infrastructure entity establish a relationship with its local CISA team. To contact your region’s office, visit\nEnroll in Vulnerability Scanning\n. Enroll in free services, particularly the\nVulnerability Scanning program\n, to identify and repair vulnerabilities exploited by PRC cyber actors.\nLeverage CISA’s Resources\n. CISA offers free tools and resources to help SMBs protect their people, customers and investments:\nSmall and Medium Businesses | Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA\nResolve to Be Resilient\nCommitting to resilience\nmeans doing the work up front—whether at a personal or organizational level—to be ready. It also means anticipating, preparing, and putting plans and measures in place to better withstand and recover rapidly when an incident occurs.\nBut the burden of securing our infrastructure should not fall on SMBs alone. Technology underpins our nation’s infrastructure and economy—it provides the necessary connectivity to fuel innovation, ideas, production, and service delivery.  Unfortunately, much of our technology is dangerously insecure at the time of sale, enabling even the most basic cyber intrusions at speed and scale and putting us all at risk. That’s why technology manufacturers must assume responsibility for securing their products from the design and development phases. In line with the National Cybersecurity Strategy, CISA’s\nmovement seeks to drive the adoption of the principles outlined here to ensure that technology products are designed and built in a way that reasonably protects against malicious cyber actors successfully exploiting product defects:\nTake Ownership of Customer Security Outcomes.\nTechnology manufacturers should make improving the real-world security posture of their customers a core business requirement and make the requisite investments in application hardening, application security features and application default settings.\nEmbrace Radical Transparency and Accountability.\nTechnology manufacturers should share lessons learned and best practices to raise the standard of security in the industry. They should also be accountable to their customers through transparency regarding investments, pricing, features, components and security—as well as product defects and their root causes. We cannot manage what we can’t measure.\nWhile technical subject matter expertise is critical to product security, it is not a matter that can be left solely to technical staff. Quality and security are business priorities that must start at the top—and manufacturers should name an executive sponsor to influence product investment to achieve customer security outcomes.\nThe more than 33 million small businesses in the United States, comprising 99.9 percent of all U.S. firms, form the backbone of our economy. CISA is undertaking urgent action to shield these businesses from nation-state cyber threats. To learn more about CISA’s efforts around the PRC, visit\n.

      "content": "Opening Statement by CISA Director Jen Easterly\nBefore the House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Homeland Security on the Fiscal Year 2025 Budget for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nCritical Infrastructure Security and Resilience\nChairman and Ranking Member Cuellar, members of the subcommittee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify on CISA's budget. As America's Cyber Defense Agency and the National Coordinator for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, CISA leads the national effort to understand, manage and reduce risk to our cyber and physical infrastructure.\nAnd I'm particularly excited to be talking to you today given this morning's release of National Security Memorandum 22, which reinforces CISA's role of managing cross sector risk to the cyberinfrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day. The FY'25 president's budget requests $3 billion for CISA, $136 million more than what you appropriated in FY '24. It's critically important to continue the strong and steady investment Congress has made in CISA's mission to protect the nation from increasingly complex threats.\nWhile our mission is broad and diverse, I'm going to briefly highlight just three areas that encompass the increases that we're requesting and in response to your specific direction from last year, I'm going to point out how we've linked outcomes to appropriations, specifically how we're using the budget to materially drive down risk in communities across the nation.\nFirst key area, federal cybersecurity. As the operational lead for the.gov, we leveraged some $600 million to defend these .gov networks as a single enterprise, protecting America's sensitive data and federal agencies. And through Congress's support, we've been able to detect and respond faster than ever before.\nOne, using that CDM program that the ranking member mentioned, we've been able to remediate over 25 million unpatched vulnerabilities and reduce the number of vulnerabilities that have been exposed for 45 days or more by 72 percent. Two, we've deployed endpoint detection and response tools to over 50 agencies covering 900,000 devices and deployed detections that allowed us to find over 1900 threats so that we could mitigate risk to .gov networks.\nAnd three, our shared services deployed to 100 federal agencies are saving taxpayer dollars. Our Protective Domain Name Solution service for example, has blocked more than 692 million malicious connections since the start of this fiscal year. Second key area of investment is we look at the threats to our nation.\nNone is more serious than Chinese cyber actors that are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to prepare to launch disruptive and destructive attacks in the event of a major conflict. Now we're doing a lot on this. To your point, we can do more. But let me tell you what we're doing now with our budget.\nFirst, we deployed threat hunting teams across multiple sectors, water, power, energy, and transportation to find and eradicate these Chinese cyber actors. And we've shared insights with others before they become victims. Now these PRC hunting missions are just part of our larger hunting missions. In just FY '23, we conducted 97 hunt engagements to eradicate threat actors from US critical infrastructure and we shared over 1,100 cyber advisories to enable risk reduction at scale.\nTwo, we use our CyberSentry platform that is best in class detection to enable us to drive down risk to the most important critical infrastructure, talking pipelines, energy generation, large airports, and critical manufacturing. We have 30 companies with 15 more joining. Three are Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative or JCDC. Now with 320 private sector companies has an active planning effort with key industry partners to mitigate risk from Chinese targeting as part of a broader risk reduction effort which has produced 93 joint cyber alerts and 14 cyber defense plans.\nFinally, third key area of investment, while nearly all critical infrastructure sectors are priority targets for nation state actors and cyber criminals, many do not have the resources to protect themselves. So based on the budget you've given us, we've stood in to support them. Specifically, we've grown our field presence across the nation by 35 percent, quadrupling the engagements that we have across the country fourfold from '22 to '23. We've leveraged our pre-ransomware notification initiative to do 1,900 such notifications -- schools, water facilities, hospitals --  to prevent organizations from suffering from ransomware.\nWe've also used our vulnerability warning pilot 2,000 notifications to organizations driving mitigation of over 3 million vulnerabilities across 7,600 organizations since 2022. And of note, our ability to proactively warn businesses will only increase when we implement cyber incident reporting.

Whether these businesses are found in small towns, big cities, or places in between, there are practical steps you can take to secure them against cyberattacks. As many of us have seen in the news or witnessed firsthand, cyberattacks like ransomware can abruptly shut down a small business--utterly devastating its owners, employees, and customers; sometimes even impacting the larger community.They are the target of cyber criminals because small businesses don’t always have the resources to invest in cybersecurity. So, during this year’s National Small Business Week (April 28-May 4), I am personally inviting you to use the many free resources offered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to create cyber safety habits that will help you Secure Your Business. To get started, implement these four simple cybersecurity steps:Train staff to recognize phishing. Emphasize the harm phishing emails can cause while educating employees on what to look for in a phishing email and encouraging everyone to think before they click on any links or attachments.  Require strong passwords. As the first line of defense in stopping criminals from accessing accounts, passwords should be random, unique, and at least 16 characters long. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts and enable an enterprise-level password manager so that the only password you need to remember is the one for the password manager.  Require multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA requires more than a password to access your accounts, such as a texted code, biometric scan, or access card. With more than 310 million smartphone users in the U.S., it’s easy to use a smartphone or tablet to implement MFA. Update any software used for business. Out-of-date software is easily exploited to steal business, employee, and customer data. Enable automatic software updates on connected devices used for business so they automatically get the latest security patches. It is also incredibly important to be aware of any outdated or unsupported software or hardware, so make sure to inventory and update them.You can find additional online resources by visiting Secure Our World Secure Our World, CISA’s enduring, year-round cybersecurity awareness program that uses creative campaigns to teach the American public easy ways to stay safe online. We continually release new content so bookmark the page, revisit it often, and share the messaging with your employees, your friends and family, and throughout your business community. If you’re looking for CISA resources closer to home, CISA has regional offices throughout the U.S. where our field personnel provide a variety of risk management and response services to help businesses become more resilient to cyber and physical threats.In addition to these perennial resources, this year, CISA is also hosting a virtual booth at the National Small Business Week Virtual Summit where registered attendees can access resources to boost their cyber resiliency. Hosted by the U.S. Small Business Administration and SCORE, the April 30 – May 1 summit recognizes America’s small businesses for their hard work, ingenuity, and dedication and will feature educational workshops, networking opportunities, and access to other federal resources. If you’re attending, be sure to check out the CISA booth.Additionally, every year in October, we work with our voluntary partners—who are critical to our mission and our shared success—to lead the nation in celebrating Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Want to become a Cybersecurity Awareness Month Partner? Email us at Awareness Campaigns. As you consider which combination of resources will best help you start or expand your small businesses’ cybersecurity practices, I also encourage you to make it a point to talk about cybersecurity to your entire organization, no matter the size. Having these conversations helps establish a culture of security—making cybersecurity the everyday activity it needs to be to Secure Your Business and Secure Our World.Alaina R.

Together, Software Understanding and Secure by Design promise to give technology customers and end users additional tools to be able to demand better cybersecurity from their software developers.Last year, CISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) convened a government-wide workshop on Software Understanding for National Security (SUNS) hosted by the DHS Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate. The purpose of the workshop was to explore the potential development of additional automated tools that would enable integrators and users of software to gain understanding without needing to rely so heavily on manual analysis, such as reverse engineering.

Based on recent industry reporting, it costs businesses an average of $1.85 million to recover from a ransomware attack.1 In addition, 80% of victims who paid a ransom were targeted and victimized again by these criminals.2 The economic, technical, and reputational impacts of ransomware incidents, throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery, continue to pose a challenge for organizations large and small. To directly reduce the attack surface and impact of ransomware attacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) focuses on proactive risk reduction through direct communication with federal government, state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) government, and critical infrastructure entities to prevent threat actors from accessing and deploying ransomware on their networks. Aligned with the Joint Ransomware Task Force, this pilot provides timely notification to critical infrastructure organizations to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect their networks and systems by using existing services, data sources, technologies, and authorities.  A key service used for warning organizations of ransomware-related vulnerabilities is our Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning, which monitors internet connected devices for known vulnerabilities and is available to any organization. Organizations participating in this no-cost service typically reduce their risk and exposure by 40% within the first 12 months and most see improvements in the first 90 days. Because the service looks for exposed assets, whether planned or inadvertent, it identifies vulnerabilities that would otherwise go unmanaged. For its use in support of RVWP, it informs organizations of those vulnerabilities commonly associated with known ransomware exploitation.  For Calendar Year (CY) 2023, RVWP completed 1,754 notifications to entities operating an internet-accessible vulnerable device. Following notification of the vulnerabilities, CISA regularly conducts vulnerability scans to determine whether the entities appear to have mitigated their vulnerable devices. Our findings indicated that 852 of the 1,754 notifications (49%) of vulnerable devices were either patched, implemented a compensating control, or taken offline after notification from CISA. Our regional teams work closely with notified entities in order to drive timely mitigation.  Critical Infrastructure SectorTotalsChemical15Commercial34Communications15Critical Manufacturing69Defense Industrial Base12Emergency Services17Energy173Financial Services127Food and Agriculture54Government Facilities641*Healthcare and Public Health440Information Technology64Transportation83Water and Wastewater10Totals1,754Table 1: RVWP Notification Breakdown by CI Sector *Value includes notifications for K-12 schools and districts, higher education facilities, SLTT government organizations, and U.S federal agencies.  The RVWP program enables organizations from all critical infrastructure sectors to harden their networks with respect to the vulnerabilities that ransomware gangs are known to use. As a result, it reduces the effectiveness of ransomware gang tools and procedures. With RVWP we are increasing their operational costs and contributing to deterrence by denial.   Giving organizations an opportunity to mitigate known vulnerabilities on their internet exposed devices also significantly helps organizations reduce their likelihood of a cyber incident. Currently, CISA Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning has more than 7,600 organizations across all sectors and has identified more than 3M known vulnerabilities for participants since 2022. By partnering with CISA in this service you're not just securing your digital assets; you're making a no-cost, low-risk strategic choice to achieve measurable improvements and proactively protect your business's reputation and future!  We urge organizations to take the following actions to help #StopRansomware: Enroll in the no-cost CISA Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning, it's not just about pinpointing vulnerabilities; it's helping organizations raise their cybersecurity posture and reduce business risk.  Review the #StopRansomware Guide, which includes a valuable and very useful checklist on how to respond to a ransomware incident and protect your organization.   Always report observed ransomware activity, including indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), to CISA and our federal law enforcement partners.   [1] Sophos, rep.

      "content": "Secure by Design Turns 1!\nAuthors: Lauren Zabierek, Bob Lord, Jack Cable\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nIn April 2023, CISA kicked off our\ninitiative, the agency’s effort to shift the responsibility of security from end users to technology manufacturers, in line with the\nNational Cybersecurity Strategy\n. As with any major milestone, it’s useful to pause for some self-reflection over a year’s worth of progress and lay out our goals for the year ahead.\nAt CISA, we live the cybersecurity mission every day, but no moment was as crystallizing for our agency and for our stakeholders as\nDirector Easterly’s Congressional testimony\ncyber threat from the People’s Republic of China\nin February of this year. She\n, “CISA teams have found and eradicated Chinese intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors, including aviation, energy, water, and telecommunications. And what we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg... The truth is that, in many cases, the PRC is taking advantage of known product defects.”\nSoftware insecurity is threat-agnostic—well-known and easily-exploited classes of defect make it easy for nation-state adversaries and criminals alike to compromise our critical infrastructure and put Americans at unacceptable risk. And so our Secure by Design initiative seeks to drive adoption of principles and approaches to prevent these defects from the design stage, where it is possible to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities.\nOver the last year, CISA has driven momentum on the Secure by Design initiative by shifting the conversation and providing measurable and actionable recommendations to technology manufacturers. With domestic and international partners, we released two versions of our white paper,\nShifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk\n, as well as guidance urging software manufacturers to adopt\nmemory safety roadmaps\n. We also developed a new\nSecure by Design alert series\nwhich ties breaches in the news to the well-known product defects that enabled them. One of our most recent alerts focused on SQL injection vulnerabilities–a well-known type of defect that we continue to see widespread exploitation of, including some of the most pernicious ransomware extortion campaigns last year, despite knowing how to prevent these defects at scale for over 20 years.\nWe can’t keep issuing calls to customers to “patch harder” and expect that things will change. Technology manufacturers must focus on eliminating entire classes of vulnerability, rather than playing “whack-a-mole” with their defects.  Many other industries have matured their processes to focus on customer safety—so too can the software industry. Remember, before a safer car could be made, we had to believe in the idea of a safer car. And that’s what we are asking of technology.\nIn addition to shifting the conversation, we’ve worked to get feedback from the public and the security community. Last summer, we held a “red pen” session at the annual hacker conference DEF CON in Las Vegas where we asked participants to mark up our draft Secure by Design white paper and provide feedback. Earlier this year, we issued a\nrequest for information\nto the public soliciting discussion on key questions surrounding economics and education, which we’re now reviewing responses to help inform our Secure by Design initiative and guidance going forward. And throughout the last 12 months, we’ve hit the road, speaking at various conferences and events, including South by Southwest, to take our message mainstream.\nCISA has also worked to drive adoption of Secure by Design software through federal procurement. In March, the Office of Management and Budget and CISA announced the release of the\nsecure software development attestation form\n, which is a core outcome of the President’s Executive Order 14028, which requires companies who supply software to the federal government to attest to secure software development practices.\nWe are proud of the progress we’ve made over the last year, but we know there is much more to do to achieve long-lasting security and resilience.  As we head into our sophomore year, we at CISA will continue to educate the public on Secure by Design, drive adoption of the principles, and publish technical guidance for industry. We also plan to expand in the following ways in support of our vision:\nDrive awareness and a “secure by demand” approach to help customers know what to say to push their vendors to do better;\nWork to understand the costs and other economic forces that impact software security and insecurity;\nWork with the academic and educational communities to incorporate security into their computer science and coding programs.\nWe know we cannot do this alone. We appreciate the many partners across industry, civil society, the open source community, and academia who have joined us in this important endeavor. We’re optimistic that technology companies will join us, too. We believe that Secure by Design is our best hope for a more resilient future for our families, and for our country. We look forward to partnering to continue to advance progress.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

While many of these tactics are not new, recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology have made it much easier and cheaper to generate and spread convincing foreign malign influence content.\n“The elections process is the golden thread of American democracy, which is why our foreign adversaries deliberately target our elections infrastructure with their influence operations. Defending our democratic process is the responsibility of all of us,” said CISA Senior Advisor Cait Conley.  “CISA is committed to doing its part to ensure these officials – and the American public – don’t have to fight this battle alone.  We will continue to work with the election community to ensure they have the tools and information they need to run safe and secure elections in 2024 and beyond.\n“The FBI and its partners work diligently every day to disrupt foreign malign influence operations targeting our democratic institutions,” said Acting Assistant Director Joseph Rothrock of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division. “We are putting out this guide because our strategy in combatting this threat starts with awareness and collaboration. We will continue to relentlessly pursue bad actors looking to disrupt our election infrastructure.”\n“Foreign actors continue to pursue efforts aimed at sowing discord among the American people, with the ultimate goal of eroding confidence in our democratic institutions,” said ODNI Foreign Malign Influence Center Director Jessica Brandt. “The normalization of influence activities, combined with the rise of new technologies, increasingly presents a whole-of-society challenge for the Intelligence Community to address alongside the broader U.S. Government, industry, and civil society.”\nSecuring Election Infrastructure Against the Tactics of Foreign Malign Influence Operations\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nStatement from CISA Director Easterly on the Security of the 2024 Elections\nJoint Statement from CISA and EAC in Support of State and Local Election Officials\nCISA Launches #PROTECT2024 Election Threat Updates Webpage\nCISA and USPIS Release Two Election Mail Security Resources",

He understands the Asian culture of being reluctant to ask for help and he empathizes with all ethnicities who struggle with the challenges of daily life simply because of their cultural heritage.\nThis is what made Chung a perfect presenter for the recent Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Economic Summit in Seattle attended by many different Seattle area ethnic groups. The Summit, part of a White House initiative to help connect these important ethnic groups with critical resources in their communities, featured many federal agency speakers, including Allen, who spoke about cyber and protective security.\nChung shared with attendees how CISA connects stakeholders with tools and resources helping them fortify their cyber, communications, and physical security. The end goal, to build resilience and strengthen neighborhoods and entire communities against outside attackers.\n“We want to encourage everyone to reach out to us,” Chung said. “It’s our mission to reduce risk across U.S. critical infrastructure, our states, and our communities.\nChung stressed the importance of being able to present to this group because they often won’t ask for assistance or help due to their cultural upbringing.\n“It’s not a community who traditionally reaches out and government doesn’t always understand these groups need a face to connect with and help them understand the resources that are available,” Chung said.\nChung also believes these groups are not likely targets because of their ethnicity, but because they have weak defenses.\n“Cyber incidents aren’t typically racially profiled. Instead, they are targets of opportunity and attackers are looking for the weakest link,” Chung added.\nAANHPI Heritage Month is May, and it allows us to recognize Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander contributions throughout history. There are more than 23 million people of Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander descent in the United States. They trace their background to a region that covers more than one-third of the earth and includes the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Pacific.\nChung said working with ethnic associations has more impact on these groups because of the “one to many” messaging that can occur. One presentation to a specific group can reach an entire ethnic community, eventually. And while Chung focused his message on this group for the White House event, he is a firm believer that all ethnic groups need to be treated equally when it comes to accessing government resources.\n“Every ethnicity is deserving of our help,” Chung said. “Having that mindset is critical to reaching into all sectors of our community and making an impact.”\nTo learn more about how CISA is working on supporting inclusion and equality visit:\nFoster Belonging, Diversity, Inclusion, and Equality.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

      "content": "Idaho’s Higher Ed Leaders Participate in CISA-Led Cybersecurity Exercise\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nHigher education leaders from across Idaho gathered for the first time to learn how to manage a ransomware attack and what steps to take to measurably reduce their cyber risk and protect students and faculty using a real-world scenario.\nBut this exercise had a twist.\nTypically, college and university information technology (IT) staff would manage the response to the ransomware simulated attack for these exercises. For this one, IT staff were asked to sit on the sideline and observe as they watched their presidents and senior leaders try and manage the cyber-intrusion.\nIdaho Cybersecurity State Coordinator for CISA, Josh Stemp, said the exercise was intended to stress the response system by removing key players who typically could help solve the problems and recover from a cyberattack.\n“We found that the senior leadership wasn’t prepared to solve it,” Stemp said. “It displayed the value of having IT at the decision-making table all the time.”\nIn the scenario, the ransomware attack was both cyber and physical, with critical systems like doors locking and temperatures of buildings spiking and dropping in addition to student data being compromised.\nStemp noted some eventually “closed” their college campuses in the scenario, while others chose to push on, trying to overcome the challenges presented in the exercise. The ransomware taking over buildings and locking doors showed the higher education leaders how damaging these attacks can be and how important communication is with other departments and even other institutions.\n“One of the unexpected outcomes was the realization of the importance of communicating with other schools,” Stemp said. “This really opened the door for these institutions to work together when situations like this occur.”\nThe event was held in coordination with the Idaho State Board of Education, the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), and all eight of Idaho’s public two-year and four-year higher education institutions.\n“This exercise was a valuable opportunity for non-technical senior leaders in higher education to come together and practice organizational responses, as well as share best practices and work on improving coordination among our different organizations, said Rick Aman, president of College of Eastern Idaho. “Ultimately, our shared goal is to protect the privacy of Idaho residents by safeguarding our data, systems, and infrastructure through partnerships and trainings like these.”\nThis training served as a relaunch of leadership training that had been previously put on pause by the pandemic.\n“The exercise was a great success,” said Cheryl Dowd, senior director of the State Authorization Network at WICHE “It provided Idaho’s higher education community with valuable information to keep our students and faculty data safe.”\nStemp and others believe the training highlighted areas where improvements can be made to help thwart a real-world cyberattack and it also had led to ongoing discussions among the participants for future collaborations.\n“This training served as an initial step toward a stronger and more secure cyber future for Idaho’s colleges and universities,” said Stemp. “This sets the tone for our state’s schools with simple, prioritized actions to reduce cyberattack risk.”\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

They also asked CISA to discuss the importance of protecting data and devices while traveling.\n“This presentation is important for CISA because Expedia is a not only a national, but a world leader in online travel,” said Cybersecurity Advisor Salazar. “They have to safeguard thousands of traveler information profiles and by presenting our cyber resilience goals for Cybersecurity Awareness Month, CISA was able to amplify this message globally.”\nProtective Advisor Cavazos started by detailing personal security measures such as being aware of your surroundings and staying in well-lit, public areas. Advisor Salazar then shared cybersecurity tips focusing on CISA’s recent year-round campaign, Secure Our World and the four most important steps to staying cyber safe; Use Strong Passwords, Enable MFA, Recognize and Report Phishing, and Update Software.\nThe presentation concluded with Protective Security Advisor Spring detailing the convergence of cyber of protective security. She shared the importance of aligning the physical and cyber protection strategies to bring a more robust approach to the overall protection of a company. She also emphasized that many attacks occur in both spaces and understanding how the two relate will only enhance a company’s resiliency.\n“It was important their staff understand how the two work together in staying safe as you travel during the upcoming holiday season,” said Spring.\nCISA Region 10 officials anticipate future opportunities to assist Expedia and other regional businesses in improving their respective cybersecurity and protective security footprints.\n“Any time you can present to a Fortune 500 company with a rather large international component you want to take that opportunity to share your most vital information,” added Advisor Cavazos. “We look forward to further developing our relationship with Expedia Group.”\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration",

      "content": "CISA Partners with State’s K-12 Schools Fighting Cyberattacks to Keep Kids Learning\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nWashington State Cybersecurity Coordinator Ian Moore fondly recalls his days playing defense for the Cascade High School football team in Everett, WA, north of Seattle. Fast forward three decades and Moore now finds himself still helping his school with his defensive expertise, but this time a little more is at stake than preventing a touchdown.\nNow, Moore is helping his alma mater protect against cyberattacks as a member of the Region 10 CISA team, whose job it is to work with regional critical infrastructure partners to secure their networks and build resilience to outside cyber intrusions.\nMoore’s work, and that of scores of other cybersecurity advisors across the nation, is now focusing on our schools – considered to be a significant target of malicious cyber intruders.\nSchools and districts are particularly exposed to cyberattacks and are an especially lucrative and vulnerable target given the presence of sensitive student and staff data. Impacts from cyberattacks have ranged from restricted access to networks and data, delayed exams, canceled school days, and unauthorized access to personal information.\nAdditionally, the relationship Americans have with the schools their children attend changed dramatically over the last few years. Now, parents and students alike are interacting with schools and teachers online in a variety of new ways, from online grading and information on class assignments, to instructor communication, paying lunch balances, and scheduling classes.\nCISA recognizes that many K-12 entities don’t often have the resources needed to defend themselves from cyber threats, like ransomware attacks. Cybersecurity advisors like Moore are there to help and more and more districts are relying on that help to shore up their network defenses.\n“Any data breach or outage results in student learning loss and we can’t afford that,” said Everett School District Chief Information Officer, Brian Beckley. “Since working with CISA the bar has been raised when it comes to managing our systems in a more secure manner.”\nBeckley said CISA’s services from alerts of possible attacks to scanning their networks looking for vulnerabilities has resulted in improved security, but he added it’s an ongoing challenge.\n“We take our security very seriously and work on it day and night,” Beckley said. “We’re glad to have a partner like CISA at our side.”\nThe Everett School district isn’t alone. Other districts, like the Northshore School District in Western Washington, have also benefitted from working with CISA to strengthen their cyber defenses. While many districts have the knowledge of what it takes to secure their networks, oftentimes, there are not the resources in place to fund the necessary defenses against cyberattacks.\nThe free CISA Cyber Hygiene vulnerability scanning service is one that has proven to be invaluable to the district, according to Alexander Delgadillo, Network Security Engineer for Northshore School District.\n“We have resolved several issues that were direct findings from the CISA services,” Delgadillo said. “Having access to a quality service has been incredibly helpful for improving our security posture, and this is one resource that would add so much benefit for other districts at no cost.”\nWahkiakum School District Superintendent Brent Freeman echoed those thoughts. His district typifies the phrase, target rich-cyber poor as being one of the poorest districts in the state with funding challenges at every level. For Freeman, cybersecurity is a must, but there’s simply no funds to adequately protect the schools there.\nMoore recently led a training session for teachers and administrators focused on protection against a cyberattack given their current situation - limited infrastructure, an IT staff of one, and a nearly non-existent budget. He zeroed in on such safety measures as creating complex passwords, backing up information to the cloud, being cautious of email attachments, and sharing ransomware response procedures.\n“It was really great for CISA to come in and tell us what we were doing right and where we needed improvements,” Freeman said. “Having the CISA visit was perfect.”\nFor Moore, helping schools is an important part of his work, considering all that’s at stake. But one district in particular has a special place in Moore’s heart – Everett Public Schools.\n“They spent all this effort educating me from the sixth grade on and when I graduated I left the area, traveled the world and now I’m back, thirty years later,” Moore said. “Being able to give back and support them is the best feeling and the greatest value I can take from this work because I have some skin in the game.”\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration",

      "content": "Lessons from XZ Utils: Achieving a More Sustainable Open Source Ecosystem\nBy: Jack Cable, Senior Technical Advisor, and Aeva Black, Section Chief, Open Source Software Security\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nA month ago at CISA, we held our first\nOpen Source Software Security Summit\n, bringing together leaders from open source foundations, package repositories, civil society, and industry. As part of this summit, we held a tabletop exercise testing coordination of community response to a hypothetical vulnerability under active exploitation in a widely used open source library. Participants noted that they gained an improved awareness of CISA’s ability to assist in coordinating response efforts between private sector and OSS non-profits, as well as new insights into how their organizations could implement resilient recovery plans.\nLittle did we know how soon the lessons from the tabletop would be applicable. The XZ Utils compromise – a multi-year effort by a malicious threat actor to gain the trust of the package’s maintainer and inject a backdoor – highlighted the fragility of key points in the open source ecosystem, the very real and ongoing risks created by maintainer burnout, and the enormous benefits realized through open collaboration as demonstrated by the communities’ response. We are fortunate that the open nature of the wider open source ecosystem allowed a developer to spot this supply chain compromise before it could cause much harm. Next time, we may not be as lucky.\nThis compromise highlights a fundamental shift needed:\nevery technology manufacturer that profits from open source software must do their part by being\nresponsible consumers\nof and sustainable contributors to\nthe open source packages they depend on\nSecure by Design initiative\n, the burden of security shouldn’t fall on an individual open source maintainer—as it did in this case to near-disastrous effect. Rather, companies consuming open source software must contribute back – either financially or through developer time – to ensure a sustainable ecosystem where open source projects have healthy and diverse maintainer communities that are resilient to burnout.\nTechnology manufacturers and system operators that incorporate OSS are responsible for the safety of the systems they build and operate, and should work to ensure – either directly or by supporting maintainers – that a\nsoftware development approach is being followed. This includes regular code reviews, eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities, applying security scanning tools, isolating build environments, having a documented process for responding to vulnerability reports and security incidents, and more.\nAt CISA, we’ve been working hand-in-hand with many open source communities to drive a more resilient open source ecosystem so that organizations across the world can continue to reap the countless benefits of open source software. As laid out in our\n, we’re working on a number of areas, including to build relationships with open source communities, understand open source prevalence, secure the federal government’s use of OSS, and help secure the broader open source ecosystem.\nSpecific to the XZ Utils compromise, through CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), we are collaborating in real-time with open source community members to better understand the impact. More broadly, we’re continuing our efforts to secure open source, including\nworking with package repositories\nto scale out security improvements to entire open source ecosystems. We’ve also released the\nfrom our tabletop exercise that any open source community can use to practice and refine their incident response coordination abilities.\nInterested in helping support CISA’s open source security efforts?

The Directive was initially issued to federal agencies on April 2\nbased upon currently available threat information and limited applicability of relevant actions, which are predicated on notification of exposed credentials by Microsoft. This Directive requires agencies to analyze potentially affected emails, reset any compromised credentials, and take additional steps to secure privileged Microsoft Azure accounts.\nMidnight Blizzard is using information initially exfiltrated from Microsoft corporate email systems, including authentication details shared between Microsoft customers and Microsoft by email, to gain, or attempt to gain, additional access to certain Microsoft customer systems. Microsoft and CISA have notified all federal agencies whose email correspondence with Microsoft was identified as exfiltrated by Midnight Blizzard.\n“As America’s cyber defense agency and the operational lead for federal civilian cybersecurity, ensuring that federal civilian agencies are taking all necessary steps to secure their networks and systems is among our top priorities. This Emergency Directive requires immediate action by agencies to reduce risk to our federal systems,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “For several years, the U.S. government has documented malicious cyber activity as a standard part of the Russian playbook; this latest compromise of Microsoft adds to their long list. We will continue efforts in collaboration with our federal government and private sector partners to protect and defend our systems from such threat activity.”\nAs federal civilian agencies implement this mandate, CISA will assess and support agency adherence and provide additional resources as required. CISA is committed to using its cybersecurity authorities to gain greater visibility and drive timely risk reduction across federal civilian agencies.\nWhile ED 24-02 requirements apply only to FCEB agencies, other organizations may also have been impacted by the exfiltration of Microsoft corporate accounts and are encouraged to contact their respective Microsoft account team for guidance. Regardless of direct impact, all organizations are strongly encouraged to apply stringent security measures, including strong passwords,\nmultifactor authentication\n(MFA) and prohibited sharing of unprotected sensitive information via unsecure channels.\nFor more information on CISA Directives, visit\nCybersecurity Directives\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

Attendees included state 911 administrators, state and local representatives from 911 centers and IT/cyber communities, Tribal Nation representatives, and Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWICs) from each state and territory. The symposium also brought together an array of internal CISA resources such as Cybersecurity Advisors (CSAs) and Emergency Communication Coordinators (ECCs) who represent a specific state or states within each CISA region.\nThis symposium, coinciding with\nCISA’s Emergency Communications Month\n, highlights the pivotal role emergency communications play in safeguarding our communities, emphasizing the imperative of establishing resilient systems and fostering collaboration. Building on this collaboration is crucial for enhancing nationwide interoperability and strengthening stakeholder relationships, especially in emergency communication systems like 911. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA) continue to partner with CISA to engage stakeholders to determine cybersecurity priorities for the CR911 Program.\nAt the symposium, speakers and panelists presented an overview of the current cyber threat landscape and shared resources to help enhance the cybersecurity posture of Emergency Communication Centers (ECCs). Symposium topics included the current state of cyber resilience in the 911 ecosystem, best practices for responding to a cyberattack, including an overview of lessons learned from the Curry County, Oregon cyberattack, and the available cybersecurity resources for each region. CISA facilitators utilized interactive live polling, breakout sessions and group discussions to gather stakeholders’ current needs, concerns, and capability gaps with regard to cybersecurity. Attendees also participated in a tabletop discussion focused on a simulated cyberattack scenario.\nBilly Bob Brown, Jr., CISA’s Executive Assistant Director for Emergency Communications, shared his sentiments following the program’s third symposium, “We’ve been fortunate to organize successful events in both the Northeast and Southeast regions, which I knew would carry over to the West. Working alongside 911 stakeholders in this region, as well as our federal partners at the FCC, NHTSA, and NTIA, and speakers from other CISA divisions and federal agencies, has been a remarkable experience. Each region provides a unique and invaluable perspective for their local communities. By actively listening to their challenges and feedback, we’ve gained crucial insights into building a secure and resilient 911 ecosystem—one that can effectively safeguard our nation’s ECCs against evolving cyber threats.”\nCISA continues its efforts to reach 911 stakeholders at its next regional symposium in May 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. This symposium will include\nCISA’s Central regions\n5 and 7. The insights gathered from this symposium will inform refinements to the CR911 Program and guide the development of stakeholder-driven products tailored to the needs of the 911 community.

Malware Next-Gen allows CISA to more effectively support our partners by automating analysis of newly identified malware and enhancing the cyber defense efforts.\nTimely, actionable intelligence on malware, such as how it works and what it is designed to do, is crucial to network defenders conducting potential cyber incident response and/or threat hunts.  Malware Next-Gen provides advanced and reliable malware analysis on a scalable platform, capable of meeting the increasing demands of future workloads. The integrated system provides CISA analysts and operations community members with multilevel containment capabilities for the automatic analysis of potentially malicious files or uniform resource locators (URLs).\n“Effective and efficient malware analysis helps security professionals detect and prevent malicious software from enabling adversary access to persistence within an organization. Malware Next-Gen is a significant leap forward in CISA's commitment to enhancing national cybersecurity,” said\nCISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Eric Goldstein\n. “Our new automated system enables CISA’s cybersecurity threat hunting analysts to better analyze, correlate, enrich data, and share cyber threat insights with partners. It facilitates and supports rapid and effective response to evolving cyber threats, ultimately safeguarding critical systems and infrastructure.”\nSince November, Malware Next-Gen has been available to .gov and .mil organizations. Nearly 400 registered users have submitted more than 1,600 files resulting in the identification of approximately 200 suspicious or malicious files and URLs, which were quickly shared with partners. While members of the public may submit a malware sample; only authorized, registered users are able to receive analytical results from submissions.\nAll organizations, security researchers and individuals are encouraged to register and submit suspected malware into this new automated system for CISA analysis.

      "content": "CISA Joins the Minimum Viable Secure Product Working Group\nBy: Jack Cable, Senior Technical Advisor and Bob Lord, Senior Technical Advisor\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nToday, we’re excited to announce that CISA is joining the\nMinimum Viable Secure Product\n(MVSP) Working Group. Since launching CISA’s global Secure by Design initiative last year, we’ve received a tremendous amount of feedback (including through our Request for Information that recently closed!).\nOne of the key questions we’ve gotten is how organizations consuming software can ask the right questions of their software manufacturers. Such a “secure by demand” approach is crucial to drive the uptake of secure by design principles and practices.\nToo often, procurement questionnaires are filled with long lists of questions which don’t always correlate with positive security outcomes. In order to achieve a future where technology is secure by design, companies buying software should have simple and to the point questions for their vendors.\nis an important step forward toward this goal.\noffers a simple checklist that organizations can use to strengthen security at multiple stages – to review their software vendors’ security during procurement, as a self-assessment tool for their own software, as part of their software development lifecycle (SDLC), or as contractual controls – which can go a long way towards helping ensure secure by design principles are followed. We’re excited to join the MVSP working group to help shape the direction of the initiative going forward. The MVSP is a composed of a broad coalition of technology manufacturers, and the working group is open\ninto the MVSP based on CISA’s Secure by Design guidance and are glad to be part of this effort to further build on our existing work. Through CISA’s Secure by Design guidance, including our\nSecure by Design whitepaper\nSecure by Design Alert\nseries, we’re making it clear how technology manufacturers can take ownership of their customer’s security outcomes, leading to a safer future.\nFor more information on secure by design, check out\nCISA’s Secure by Design website\n.

With the convening eight countries, we discussed options to advance the cybersecurity of civil society and calibrate our agencies’ support to the communities at highest risk. The second meeting is planned for May 2024.    Recently, CISA participated in the third Summit for Democracy in Seoul, South Korea, as part of our continuing commitment to counter cybersecurity threats against civil society. In alignment with this summit and our strategic dialogue work, CISA is providing a suite of resources on our new High-Risk Communities webpage today to help civil society organizations with bolstering their cyber defense and resilience.   These resources are the product of a year-long effort spearheaded by the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative in partnership with industry and civil society. Informed by the unique expertise and experiences of our civil society and industry partners, these resources directly respond to the unique threat profile and operational realities of high-risk organizations that are targeted by sophisticated threat actors.  As leaders of high-risk organizations know all too well, operating a robust cybersecurity program can be costly. And many sources of funding do not account for the cost of hiring and retaining information security professionals or implementing effective cybersecurity solutions. At the same time, civil society organizations and their affiliates are at heightened risk of becoming targets of Advanced Persistent Threats – and cybersecurity incidents that lead to disruptions in their work can have dire ramifications for the vulnerable communities they serve.  Here are some of the resources that CISA released today as part of its cyber defense plan to support civil society organizations:   Launch a CISA.gov Webpage for High-Risk Communities.  CISA’s High-Risk Communities webpage serves as a one-stop-shop for cybersecurity guidance and free or discounted tools and resources that are tailored to meet the needs of high-risk organizations that want to improve their cybersecurity baseline while operating with limited resources.   Release Project Upskill: CISA’s Tailored Cybersecurity Guidance for High-Risk Communities. Research from the CyberPeace Institute shows that less than 15-percent of non-governmental civil society organizations have cybersecurity experts on their staff and 33-percent do not have dedicated IT or security resources available to secure their individual employees, let alone the enterprise. That means employees at high-risk organizations serve as the first line of defense against malicious cyber actors that seek to disrupt operations or conduct reconnaissance.  Project Upskill is designed to arm individuals employed by or supporting high-risk organizations with simple steps to meaningfully improve their cyber hygiene. We crafted it to be accessible to a non-technical audience so that all individuals across civil society are empowered to support their own cyber defense.  The steps outlined in this new resource are not a “silver bullet” against cyber intrusions however, they can make it more difficult and costly for malign cyber actors to target individuals and the organization.   Highlight Free Tools & Services for Mission-Based Organizations.  Collectively, a wide array of free or discounted tools and services are available to high-risk communities. For example, certain organizations can apply to receive free cybersecurity protection under Cloudflare’s Project Galileo. Individuals who enroll in Google’s Advanced Protection Program (free to the public) benefit from additional account safeguards, including enhanced protection against phishing attempts and harmful downloads. Organizations seeking guidance on how to harden their enterprise will benefit from visiting the Global Cyber Alliance’s Cybersecurity Toolkit for Mission-Based Organizations, and high-risk individuals and organizations can turn to Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline for support with incident response if they believe they have been compromised.   All of these resources, and more, are located on CISA’s High-Risk Communities webpage.     Help Prospective Volunteers Connect with their Local Cyber Volunteer Clinic. Across the United States, academic institutions, non-profits, and municipalities are setting up cybersecurity clinics and volunteer corps to provide free, hands-on support for incident response and resilience building.   High-risk organizations often qualify for support from these volunteer clinics. Therefore, CISA is building a webpage that will have information about the cyber volunteer programs across the country. Our intent is to help build capacity by providing a centralized place for prospective volunteers to learn about prerequisites and application processes for joining their local cyber volunteer program, and help qualifying organizations learn how to obtain assistance.   At the third Summit for Democracy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, “As authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms.” We believe that the work initiated through this partnership across civil society, technology companies, the US government, and international partner governments we are contributing to a rights respecting digital world.”  Disclaimer CISA does not endorse any commercial entity, product, company, or service, including any entities, products, or services referenced or linked to on this page.

CISA encourages critical infrastructure organizations, state, local, tribal, and territorial government, and others to significantly bolster communications resiliency and emergency preparedness by enrolling in\nfree priority telecommunications services\n. These services, which include the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) and Wireless Priority Service (WPS), enable essential personnel to communicate when networks are degraded or congested due to weather events, mass gatherings, cyber incidents, or events stemming from human error.\nThrough its emergency communications mission, CISA conducts extensive outreach across the nation. These efforts are aimed at bolstering the capacity of emergency response providers and government officials to communicate effectively during crises such as natural disasters, cyber incidents or other hazards that impact landline and wireless communications. CISA’s programs and services coordinate emergency communications planning, preparation, and evaluation to ensure safer, better-prepared communities nationwide. Moreover, CISA offers essential guidance on establishing protocols for identifying and promptly reporting significant cyber incidents to relevant personnel, local law enforcement, and the agency. CISA serves as a vital resource, collaborating with both government and industry partners to strengthen and enhance emergency communication capabilities, thereby reinforcing our nation's resilience.\n“As the nation's cyber defense agency and the national coordinator for infrastructure security, CISA's mission continues to prioritize ensuring interoperable, secure, and resilient emergency communications for our nation,\" remarked\nCISA Director Jen Easterly.\n\"In this third Emergency Communications Month, we not only honor our invaluable emergency communications partners nationwide but also urge them to enroll in our priority telecommunications services. By emphasizing the 'Resilient Together' theme, we aim to unite efforts towards integrating the next generation of emergency communications systems, thereby enhancing the safety and security of our nation and its critical infrastructure.\"\nOn April 30, CISA will host an informational webinar to provide overviews of the GETS and WPS services. Organizations can begin the enrollment process here:\nwww.cisa.gov/apply-pts\n.

This marks a major step in bolstering America’s cybersecurity.\nImplementation of CIRCIA will improve CISA’s ability to use cybersecurity incident and ransomware payment information reported to the agency to identify patterns in real-time, fill critical information gaps, rapidly deploy resources to help entities that are suffering from cyber attacks, and inform others who would be potentially affected. When information about cyber incidents is shared quickly, CISA can use this information to render assistance and provide warning to prevent other organizations from falling victim to a similar incident. This information is also critical to identifying trends that can help efforts to protect the homeland. The NPRM will soon formally publish in the Federal Register, following which the public will have 60 days to submit written comments to inform the direction and substance of the Final Rule.\n“Cyber incident reports submitted to us through CIRCIA will enable us to better protect our nation’s critical infrastructure,”\nsaid Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas\n.  “CIRCIA enhances our ability to spot trends, render assistance to victims of cyber incidents, and quickly share information with other potential victims, driving cyber risk reduction across all critical infrastructure sectors. The proposed rule is the result of collaboration with public and private stakeholders, and DHS welcomes feedback during the public comment period on the direction and substance of the final rule.”\n\"CIRCIA is a game changer for the whole cybersecurity community, including everyone invested in protecting our nation’s critical infrastructure,”\nsaid CISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “It will allow us to better understand the threats we face, spot adversary campaigns earlier, and take more coordinated action with our public and private sector partners in response to cyber threats. We look forward to additional feedback from the critical infrastructure community as we move towards developing the Final Rule.\"\nSince September 2022, CISA has solicited input from public and private sector stakeholders, including the critical infrastructure community, as the agency developed the NPRM, and this open comment period is another opportunity for stakeholders to submit written comments on the NPRM. The NPRM contains proposed regulations for cyber incident and ransom payment reporting, as well as other aspects of the CIRCIA regulatory program. Implementation of CIRCIA enables CISA to develop insight into the cyber threat landscape to drive cyber risk reduction across the nation and to provide early warning to entities who may be at risk of targeting. The comments CISA received through the\nRequest for Information\nover the past year helped shape this NPRM. In turn, robust input on the NPRM will support our ability to implement CIRCIA to drive national cyber risk reduction.\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

The exercise focused on incident information sharing procedures and emergency response and recovery operations related to a hypothetical incident around local water systems as well as mechanisms to help keep the public’s drinking water safe.\nThe exercise was not in response to any specific threat and there have been no significant security incidents or changes to the threat or the risk environment impacting the NCR water systems. Rather, this exercise supported the long-standing regional efforts, led by COG, the\nInterstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB)\n, local emergency management agencies, major water providers, and other water and wastewater utilities to periodically review and improve the preparedness and resilience of the region’s water service systems. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Sector Risk Management Agency for the Water and Wastewater Sector, supported the exercise. Overall, the exercise contributed to federal goals that strengthen water system resilience locally, regionally, and nationally.\n“Drinking water and wastewater systems are an essential community lifeline. A large portion of Water Sector functions are based in the digital world as well as deeply rooted in critical physical infrastructure. It is important to protect these systems from any form of attack to maintain their vital operations,” said Regional Director Bill Ryan,\n. “Opportunities to train and exercise emergency plans as a team with our state and local partners allow us to collectively identify ways to keep the public safe, become more resilient and harden our capabilities through proactive multi-agency collaboration, coordination and strategic resource management before an incident happens.”\nThe exercise provided invaluable feedback to more than a dozen agencies regarding a variety of complex scenarios relevant to their roles and responsibilities. Specifically, the NCR Water TTX tested responses to water system threats focusing on the interconnectedness of water utilities, incident response, continuity plans, customer support, water distribution, and public messaging.\n“Planning and preparing for incidents that have significant impacts on public health and safety are only one part of ensuring readiness to respond efficiently. Exercises are the other crucial aspect of testing our plans to improve our ability to successfully address and mitigate the impacts of water system incidents,” said Clint Osborn, Interim Director of HSEMA. “We are collaborating with our local, state, and federal partners so we can hit the ground running when we are faced with incidents that threaten our critical infrastructure.”\nExercises like this one are part of CISA’s continual outreach with public and private sector partners. CISA conducts dozens of exercises per year and actively engages with entities including but not limited to municipalities, sports leagues, critical infrastructure partners, schools, and other organizations around the country to develop and exercise response plans for all potential threats in today’s complex security environment. Individually, CISA and HSEMA participate in various exercises throughout the year on multiple levels and scales. From a national perspective, CISA has staff strategically positioned throughout the U.S. to advise on ways to enhance security and resilience.

      "content": "Nothing Scares the PRC More Than a Russian Defeat in Ukraine\nBy: Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nLast month, Ambassador-At-Large for Cyber and Digital Policy Nate Fick and I traveled to Kyiv for the International Cyber Resilience Forum at the invitation of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. As the leader of America’s cyber defense agency and America’s top tech diplomat, it was an important opportunity to show our unified support for the defense of global cyberspace. In meetings with key leaders across the Ukrainian government, we saw firsthand the spirit of resilience, the bravery of the Ukrainian people, the power of innovation, and most clearly—the absolute criticality of continued U.S. support for the defense of Ukraine.\nWe stand at a critical juncture concerning Congressional funding for Ukraine’s defense. Now more than two years after Russia’s full-scale invasion and even despite recent losses on the battlefield, Ukraine has accomplished what few expected at the outset of this conflict, in no small part due to U.S. assistance. Despite being outnumbered according to nearly every meaningful metric—and even with recent setbacks on the battlefield—Ukraine has retained the vast majority of territory it controlled two years ago. Russia – a nuclear power covering 40 percent of European soil – has lost 87 percent of the number of active-duty ground troops it had prior to the invasion, and two-thirds of its pre-invasion tanks. Ukraine has largely withstood the onslaught, while galvanizing global support, advancing its European integration, strengthening NATO, and showcasing an array of security-related technology innovations. Russia, on the other hand, is isolated, and capable of transactional relationships with only the world's most irresponsible actors.\nThose relationships, however, especially on technology issues among Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, are alarming. We face a world increasingly at war where seemingly disparate conflicts—from Ukraine to the Korean Peninsula, from the Red Sea to the Taiwan Straits—include a strengthening alignment of cyber and technology collaboration among the United States’ adversaries and competitors. Thus, U.S. support for Ukraine is not only principled support for the rules-based international order or proof that the United States honors commitments to its allies. Our support for Ukraine is inextricably linked to U.S. national security and the security of our homeland.\nThis is true on many levels, but in particular in cyberspace where the digital age has largely dissolved physical barriers that once shielded us, making our critical infrastructure, the backbone of our society, vulnerable to attacks from afar. We’ve witnessed a barrage of cyber-attacks, and of course kinetic attacks, by Russia on Ukraine’s infrastructure, attacks which Ukraine has met with impressive resilience. At the same time, we know that China—which has pledged a “no-limits” partnership with Russia—has been burrowing deep into our own critical infrastructure, potentially preparing to launch destructive cyber-attacks in the event of a major conflict. This is a world where such a conflict, halfway across the planet, could well endanger the lives of Americans here at home through disruption of pipelines, pollution of our water systems, severing of our communications, and crippling of our transportation nodes—all to incite chaos and panic and deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will.\nIn this context, the war in Ukraine is not an isolated event but a potential preview of destructive cyber attacks the U.S. and our allies could face elsewhere, and what we could face here at home at the same time. A failure to defend Ukraine will not just empower Vladimir Putin and strengthen the Sino-Russian partnership and a global order that favors autocracy over democracy; a failure to defend Ukraine is a failure to deter other states with territorial or ideological ambitions, including China.\nThe PRC is watching Ukraine closely, with an eye towards Taiwan. As Congress considers providing additional support to protect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, we must remember that the fight in Ukraine is related to the conflict in the Middle East, and to stability in East Asia. Continued western support to Ukraine can serve as a strong deterrent. Now is not the moment to pause or to dither – now is the time to help Ukraine finish the fight.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

Since Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has recognized the importance of fostering a diverse and strong federal technology marketplace, while reducing cybersecurity risks. The President took decisive action in issuing Executive Order 14028,\nImproving the Nation’s Cybersecurity\n, following a sophisticated supply chain attack that allowed foreign adversaries to compromise the systems of thousands of customers who use SolarWinds.  The Executive Order initiated a transformation of Federal cybersecurity policy and practice in order to better protect the networks and infrastructure that Americans depend on.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration continues to build on that foundation with the release of the secure software development attestation form — a critical step towards ensuring software producers who work with Government provide securely developed products.\nThis action also furthers the President’s\nNational Cybersecurity Strategy\nwhich made clear that the “most capable and best-positioned actors in cyberspace must be better stewards of the digital ecosystem.” By ensuring our Government uses software products from software producers that leverage best practices for secure development, we not only strengthen the security of the Federal Government, but drive improvements for customers across the globe. We envision a software ecosystem where our partners in state and local government, as well as in the private sector, also seek these assurances and leverage software that is built to be secure by design.\nToday’s release of the secure software development attestation form reinforces\nsecure-by-design principles\nadvanced by CISA, Federal government partners, and international allies:\nTake ownership of security outcomes so the burden of security does not fall solely on the customer.\nEmbrace radical transparency and accountability\nBuild organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals\nBy using software from producers that use sound secure development practices, the Federal Government not only protects its vital information systems, but also helps ensure that the Government runs on software made by companies that prioritize and focus on these critical practices.

      "content": "Winning Team Ensures Safe Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas\nCritical Infrastructure Security and Resilience\nThe Kansas City Chiefs may have taken home the Vince Lombardi Trophy on Feb. 11 as the Super Bowl LVIII victors over the San Francisco 49ers, but CISA Region 9’s all-star team of protective security advisors, cybersecurity advisors, emergency communications coordinators, and operations, outreach and administrative professionals were the true winners. The team kept a watchful eye for any potential danger and risks to critical infrastructure in and around Allegiant Stadium from five command posts throughout Las Vegas. During the week leading up to the big event, the team also supported Super Bowl Experience, the interactive fan activity event at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center.\nRegion 9 Supervisory Protective Security Advisor Gonzalo Cordova served as the Alternate Deputy Federal Coordinator, responsible for assisting the coordination of all federal agencies supporting the SEAR 1 event.\nThe CISA Region 9 team prepared for Super Bowl LVIII for more than a year. This was the third consecutive Super Bowl to take place in the region – the past two were in Los Angeles and Glendale, Arizona – which meant that R9 staff were seasoned pros at supporting the big game. Leveraging its regional relationships with stakeholders, the CISA Region 9 team provided local partners an expansive suite of protective measures, which hardened physical and cyber security, and emergency communications interoperability. These efforts included conducting 25 Infrastructure Survey Tool and 12 Infrastructure Visualization Platform assessments on the 65,000-seat stadium and nearby critical facilities that support commercial business, healthcare and utilities. The team also assisted the Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP) with four Explosive Blast Modeling assessments. Additionally, OBP held numerous bombing prevention training workshops and deployed the\nReady Armor Protection for Instant Deployment\na portable blast resistant barrier—to the site of the NFL Honors event.\nClark County Fire Department Assistant Fire Chief Brian O’Neal said that he and his fellow local public safety counterparts lean heavily on CISA during big events like this.\n“(CISA) is one of our most important partners. They have the best idea of the federal resources coming in to support our local events,” O’Neal said. “We rely on them to develop the network of contacts and the understanding of capabilities and resources coming in, and the requirements those resources need.\n“We know what we have locally, but for these big SEAR 1 events that have a lot of federal engagement, we don’t necessarily know what that’s going to look like, but they do,” he said.\nThe Region 9 team also worked closely with the National Football League (NFL), hosting a cybersecurity tabletop exercise at Allegiant Stadium, participating in a cybersecurity and intelligence summit, and offering cybersecurity tips to local entrepreneurs during the NFL’s Business Connect event.\nDuring Super Bowl Week, the Region 9 emergency communications team coordinated local public safety agencies’ participation in the RF War Games at Allegiant Stadium. The drill allowed public safety, and radio and television broadcast communications professionals the opportunity to test and deconflict radio frequency (RF) interoperability prior to the big event. As the nation’s most-watched sporting event, the Super Bowl garners significant attention from media outlets, all using RF signals to air the game. The event addressed any potential interference issues.\n“The level of skill, experience, and, most importantly, passion our people have for keeping our country safe never fails to amaze me,” said CISA Region 9 Director David Rosado. “CISA as a whole, and certainly Region 9 personnel, are truly the best at what they do – namely, increasing the security and resilience of the critical infrastructure that we all rely on each and every day.”\nThe Region 9 team will get a brief reprieve as Super Bowl LIX will take place next year in New Orleans, before returning to the region in Santa Clara, California in 2026.\nAllegiant Stadium was the site of Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.\nAllegiant Stadium was the site of Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas.\n(l-r) CISA Region 9 Protective Security Advisor Brian Keith and Cybersecurity Advisor Jake Aguiar monitor critical infrastructure from the Multi-Agency Command Center in Las Vegas during Super Bowl LVIII Week.\n(l-r) CISA Region 9 Cybersecurity Advisor May Acosta and Protective Security Advisor Dorothy Savola monitor critical infrastructure from the Multi-Agency Command Center in Las Vegas during Super Bowl LVIII Week.\n(l-r) CISA Region 9 Protective Security Advisors Edgar Castor and Scott Mitchem monitor critical infrastructure from the Super Bowl NFL Headquarters command post in Las Vegas during Super Bowl LVIII Week.\nCISA Region 9 Emergency Communications Coordinator Artena Moon (center) and local public safety partners participate in the RF War Games drill at Allegiant Stadium to test emergency communications interoperability.\nCISA Region 9 Protective Security Advisor Matthew Crymble keeps a watchful eye at the Super Bowl Experience fan event at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas.\nThe CISA Region 9 team, along with the Clark County Fire Department, keep fans and visitors safe during Super Bowl Week.\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nCISA Through the Years: Policy and Impact\nTarget Rich, Cyber Poor: Strengthening Our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors\nFrom Naturalization to Cyber Advocacy: CISA Region 3’s Chris Ramos Inspires New U.S. Citizens",

      "content": "CISA Announces New Efforts to Help Secure Open Source Ecosystem\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nUnderscores Collaboration with the Open Source Community\nWASHINGTON – Yesterday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) concluded a two-day Open Source Software (OSS) Security Summit convening OSS community leaders and announced key actions to help secure the open source ecosystem. Recognizing that OSS underpins the essential services and functions of modern life, the Summit sought to catalyze progress in advancing security of this critical ecosystem. This urgency was underscored by security flaws such as the Log4Shell vulnerability in 2021.\nCISA Director Jen Easterly opened the summit with\nand was followed by a panel discussion with Office of National Cyber Director (ONCD) Assistant National Cyber Director for Technology Security Anjana Rajan, CISA Open Source Security Section Chief Aeva Black, and CISA Senior Technical Advisor Jack Cable. The summit also featured a tabletop exercise on open source vulnerability response and a roundtable discussion on package manager security.\nDuring the summit, OSS community leaders, including open source foundations, package repositories, civil society, industry and federal agencies explored approaches to help strengthen the security of the open source infrastructure we all rely upon. As part of this collaborative effort, CISA announced several initial key actions that CISA will take to help secure the open source ecosystem in partnership with the open source community:\nCISA, as detailed below, is working closely with package repositories to foster adoption of the\nPrinciples for Package Repository Security\nDeveloped by CISA and the Open Source Security Foundation’s (OpenSSF) Securing Software Repositories Working Group, this framework was published recently and outlines voluntary security maturity levels for package repositories.\nCISA has launched a new effort to enable voluntary collaboration and cyber defense information sharing with open source software infrastructure operators to better protect the open source software supply chain.\nMaterials from the summit’s tabletop exercise will be published by CISA so that the lessons learned can be used by any open source community to improve their vulnerability and incident response capabilities.\nAdditionally, five of the most widely used package repositories are taking steps in line with the Principles for Package Repository Security framework:\nThe Rust Foundation is working on implementing Public Key Infrastructure for the Crates.io package repository for mirroring and binary signing and plans to issue a Request for Comment. The Rust Foundation also published a detailed threat model for Crates.io and has created tooling to identify malicious activity. Further steps are highlighted in the Rust Foundation’s\nSecurity Initiative Report\nThe Python Software Foundation is working to add additional providers to PyPI for credential-less publishing (“Trusted Publishing”), expanding support from GitHub to include GitLab, Google Cloud and ActiveState as well. Work is ongoing to provide an API and related tools for quickly reporting and mitigating malware, with the goal of increasing PyPI’s ability to respond to malware in a timely manner without consuming significant resources. Finally, the Python ecosystem is finalizing PEP 740 (“Index support for digital attestations”) to enable uploading and distributing digitally signed attestations and metadata used to verify these attestations on a Python package repository, like PyPI.\nPackagist and Composer have recently introduced vulnerability database scanning and measures to prevent attackers from taking over packages without authorization. Further work to increase security in line with the Principles for Package Repository Security framework is in progress, and a thorough security audit of existing codebases will take place this year.\nThe package repository npm\nmaintainers of high-impact projects to enroll in multifactor authentication. Additionally, npm has introduced tooling that allows maintainers to automatically generate\n, giving consumers of those open source packages the ability to trace and verify the provenance of dependencies.\n) is the largest open source repository for Java and JVM languages, and enforces validation and metadata requirements with clear namespaces. Since 2021, all staged repositories have automatically been scanned for vulnerabilities when published, and developers receive a report with any security issues. In 2024, Maven Central is transitioning publishers to a new publishing portal that has enhanced repository security, including planned support for multifactor authentication. Upcoming key initiatives include\nSigstore implementation\nevaluation, and access control on namespaces. This includes Maven Central benchmarking the maturity of its security processes against best practices, which will also guide backlog prioritization.\n“Open Source Software is foundational to the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “As the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, we’re proud to announce these efforts to help secure the open source ecosystem in close partnership with the open source community, and are excited for the work to come.”\n“Open source software is a mission-critical foundation of cyberspace that the U.S. Government must continue to defend,” says\nAnjana Rajan, Assistant National Cyber Director for Technology Security\n. “Ensuring that we have a secure and resilient open source software ecosystem is a national security imperative, a technology innovation enabler, and an embodiment of our democratic values. As the chair of the Open Source Software Security Initiative (OS3I), ONCD is committed to ensuring this remains a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration and commends CISA’s leadership in convening this important forum.”\n“OpenSSF’s mission is to improve the security of open source software. Package repositories are critical infrastructure for the open source community. We thank CISA for facilitating this Open Source Software (OSS) Security Summit to help secure package repositories. Through continued cooperation in activities such as this summit and the Principles for Package Repository Security, we will improve the security of open source package repositories for everyone,”\nOmkhar Arasaratnam, General Manager, OpenSSF\n“Securing the open source software supply chain is crucial for protecting global economic infrastructure,” said\nMike Milinkovich, Executive Director of the Eclipse Foundation\n. “CISA is working to improve open source security, focusing on both current issues and future application development. We’re proud to contribute to this vital work, helping CISA improve the global development ecosystem and supporting its vision for the future.”\n“OSI and the Open Policy Alliance commend CISA for engaging with the open source software community and appreciate the opportunity to participate in this week’s Open Source Security Summit.  Including less represented, small open source non-profits into the discussion will facilitate workable, practical policies and practices, building upon the strength of the collaborative model of Open Source,” said\nDeb Bryant, US Policy Director, Open Source Initiative.\nThe federal government has coordinated its efforts around open source software security through the ONCD\nOpen Source Software Security Initiative\n. Last year, ONCD, CISA, the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Office of Management and Budget published a\nRequest for Information\n(RFI) on open source software security and memory safe languages, which received more than 100 substantive responses. The issuing agencies are currently reviewing responses and will publish a summary of the RFI submissions.\nIn 2023, CISA released its\nOpen Source Software Security Roadmap\nto help secure the federal government’s use of open source software and support the global open source ecosystem. It lays out four key goals: establishing CISA’s role in supporting the security of open source software, driving visibility into open source software usage and risks, reducing risks to the federal government, and hardening the open source software ecosystem. The actions announced today from the summit represent key steps in fulfillment of the Roadmap’s goals, including\nObjective 1.1. Partner With OSS Communities\nObjective 1.2.

Any interruption in communications can have a cascading effect, impacting a public safety agency’s ability to deliver critical lifesaving services to the community. Therefore, public safety agencies carefully plan, implement, and review communications capabilities for resiliency to maintain daily communications abilities and prepare in advance for emergency events.\nTo assist public safety agencies in navigating the wealth of information available regarding communications resiliency, CISA created the\nPublic Safety Communications and Cyber Resiliency Toolkit\nto identify and address emergent trends and issues, consolidate resources, educate stakeholders at all levels of government, and propose mitigations to enable resilient public safety communications. The Toolkit is designed to assist public safety agencies and others responsible for communications networks by providing the tools necessary to evaluate current resiliency capabilities, identify ways to improve resiliency, and develop plans for mitigating the effects of potential resiliency threats.\nThrough the use of an interactive graphic displaying components of the emergency communications ecosystem, Toolkit users can easily navigate through a number of topics and access applicable resources. Current topic areas include:\nAlerts, Warnings, and Notifications\nElectromagnetic Pulse (EMP)\nLand Mobile Radio (LMR)\nLocal Access Networks (LAN)\nNext Generation 911 (NG911)\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Disruptions\nResiliency Introduction\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)\nAs part of CISA’s commitment to provide the most up-to-date information in support of communications and cyber resiliency, the Toolkit is designed to be a living document, with the ability to grow and expand as new resources are developed and identified.\nSince its last update in August 2023, the Toolkit has been updated with seven new resources spread over the existing sections.\nUsers are encouraged to revisit the Toolkit on a regular basis to take advantage of recently added information and resources.

These vulnerabilities (\n) can be used in a chain of exploits to bypass authentication, craft malicious requests, and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. In turn, exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow lateral movement, data exfiltration, web shell deployment, credential theft including domain administrators, and persistent access on a target network.\nThis joint advisory provides technical details on observed tactics used by these threat actors and indicators of compromise to help organizations detect malicious activity. All organizations using these devices should assume a sophisticated threat actor could achieve persistence and may lay dormant for a period of time before conducting malicious activity. Organizations are urged to exercise due caution in making appropriate risk decisions when considering a virtual private network (VPN), to include whether to continue operating these Ivanti devices.\n“Since initial disclosure of these vulnerabilities, CISA and our partners have urgently worked to provide actionable guidance and assist impacted victims. This includes an\nto remove and rebuild vulnerable Ivanti devices to reduce risk to federal systems upon which Americans depend,” said\nCISA Executive Assistant Director Eric Goldstein\n. “Today’s joint advisory provides further details based upon industry partnerships, incident response findings and evaluations of the relevant products. Every organization using these products are strongly encouraged to adopt the actions outlined in this advisory.”\n“The FBI and our partners are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory so that organizations are able to protect themselves from malicious actors exploiting their networks,” said\nAssistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division.\n“Private and public sector entities should follow the guidance included in this advisory to ensure these critical vulnerabilities are mitigated.”\n“The continued targeting of widely used security applications and appliances speaks to the determination of cyber threat actors, with government entities and private organizations alike caught in the crosshairs. Implementing effective controls in areas like asset and vulnerability management, multi-factor authentication, and incident response planning are essential to operational resilience amid today's fast-moving threat landscape,” said\nRandy Rose, VP, Security Operations & Intelligence, Center for Internet Security, Inc\n“We strongly urge all organisations to patch and take other recommended actions to address this vulnerability. We know it is subject to exploitation by malicious actors who use it to bypass authentication mechanisms and access restricted data on affected devices,” said the\nacting Head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre, Phil Winzenberg\n. “If your organisation is using these products, it’s crucial that the guidance in this advisory is implemented immediately, in particular I urge critical infrastructure operators to be alert to new risks.”\n“We encourage organisations who have not already to take immediate action to mitigate vulnerabilities impacting affected Ivanti devices by following the recommended steps. This is particularly important for those organisations working across critical infrastructure, as we are aware of the active exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities,” said\nUK NCSC Chief Technology Officer Ollie Whitehouse\n. “The NCSC and our international partners also urge software manufacturers to embed secure by design principles into their practices to promote a positive security culture and help improve our collective resilience.”\n“Today we join our partners across the Five Eyes to urge organizations in Canada and internationally to follow the advice included in today’s joint advisory as quickly as possible. These vulnerabilities can significantly impact organizations’ networks, emphasizing the need for organizations to implement resilient defence-in-depth mitigations and for manufacturers to prioritize secure by design engineering practices,” said\nRajiv Gupta, Associate Head, Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.\n“This advisory clearly shows that malicious actors are continuing to seek out, and actively exploit, vulnerabilities in commonly used technology and software”, said\nRob Pope, Director CERT NZ, a part of New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre\n. “Businesses need to stay alert to these vulnerabilities and immediately follow all steps to mitigate or prevent attacks from happening. We strongly recommend that anyone working in the IT sector sign up for updates from their country’s cyber security agencies to stay ahead of the bad guys.”\nTo assist organizations with understanding the impacts of this threat, the joint advisory provides key findings from a variety of tests conducted by CISA from an attacker’s perspective.\nWith our partners, CISA recommends that software manufacturers incorporate secure-by-design and -default principles and tactics into their software development practices.

      "content": "CISA Publishes Guide to Support University Cybersecurity Clinics\nby Clayton Romans, Associate Director\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nSmall and local organizations face a unique challenge in cybersecurity. They are the target of criminal groups seeking to launch ransomware attacks, and yet they often have no good way of getting the cybersecurity resources they need to protect themselves. One answer to this problem is University Cybersecurity Clinics.\nUniversity cybersecurity clinics train students from various backgrounds and academic expertise to strengthen the digital defenses of non-profits, hospitals, municipalities, small businesses, and other under-resourced organizations, while also developing a talent pipeline for cyber civil defense.\nAs an example, the Consortium of Cybersecurity Clinics (co-chaired by the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity and the MIT Cybersecurity Clinic) coordinate across over a dozen university clinics across the country. The Consortium serves as a forum for clinicians, trainers, students, and advocates to share knowledge, expand the reach of cybersecurity clinics, and lower the barriers for other institutions to establish their own clinics.\nUniversity, college and community-college based cybersecurity clinics are filling an essential gap in cybersecurity defense in their communities\nAnn Cleaveland, Co-Chair of the Consortium of Cybersecurity Clinics and Executive Director of the UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity\nThe Consortium and our members are tremendously grateful for CISA's support for these clinics and their clients around the country. This kind of partnership is critical for advancing cybersecurity for the public good.\nCISA is well positioned to support university cybersecurity clinics and is pleased to publish today a guide for this growing community with helpful information, resources, and services. The clinics act as force-multipliers for our mission to strengthen target-rich, resource-poor organizations. Clinics can also provide valuable information to CISA regarding the state of cybersecurity and challenges in the field. They play an important role in training the next generation of cybersecurity practitioners and leaders and can act as a recruiting channel for CISA.\nAccordingly, CISA is announcing several actions to support university cybersecurity clinics.\nCISA will publish a resource guide tailored specifically for the clinics and their clients to use. It will clearly explain how the resources apply to clinics and their clients.\nRaising awareness for clinics is an invaluable tool which helps to increase support for clinics nationally and locally, spotlights the valuable experience of students who have participated in clinics, helps existing clinics connect with local and federal resources, and inspires universities to start new clinics.\nDirect Engagement with the Clinics.\nCISA will increase its engagement at the local level with clinics through our regional Cybersecurity Advisors. Our region-based Cybersecurity Advisors provide a wide range of subject matter expertise and serve as a link with CISA’s programs and services. At the national level, we will work with organizations like the Consortium of Clinics to find additional ways that CISA can support.\nCISA is taking steps to leverage our State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP), which aims to address cyber risks to information systems owned or operated by  state and local governments. In some cases, clinics may be a source for states and local governments for needed services in carrying out the scope of work under SLCGP grants and subgrants. Further, some clients may be state or local agencies themselves who are eligible for grants or subgrants to strengthen their own networks. In the resource guide, we encourage clients and clinics to work with their State Cybersecurity Planning Committee to understand available funding resources. As CISA looks toward future rounds of grants, we are exploring how to encourage states to consider clinics in their grant-related work.\nClinics can serve as a talent pipeline for the entire cybersecurity community. At CISA, we are working to include them in our recruiting efforts.\nCISA has been an impactful partner in the development of the Applied Cybersecurity Community Clinic at UT Austin. CISA’s Cybersecurity Performance Goals and other resources are included in our curriculum and recommendations to client organizations, which allows clinic students to see how their participation not only bolsters community cyber resilience but also contributes to the broader cyber defense mission of the agency\nFrancesca Lockhart, Cybersecurity Clinic Program Lead, Strauss Center for International Security and Law, The University of Texas at Austin\nI look forward to deepening our partnership with CISA and further leveraging their expertise and services as our clinic and the Consortium of Cybersecurity Clinics grows.\nIn the long-term, clinics have the potential to be a nationally scalable solution to support target-rich, resource-poor organizations. We are excited to take these first steps and look forward to ongoing engagement and support as more cybersecurity clinics spread across the country.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

Over the past six months, Microsoft has worked closely with CISA, OMB, and ONCD to roll out expanded logs to a pilot group of agencies. Beginning this month, expanded logging will be available to all agencies using Microsoft Purview Audit regardless of license tier.\nAs described in CISA’s\nguidance, all technology providers should provide “high-quality audit logs to customers at no extra charge or additional configuration.” Today’s announcement is a further step in this direction. Microsoft will automatically enable the logs in customer accounts and increase the default log retention period from 90 days to 180 days. Also, this data will provide new telemetry to help more federal agencies meet logging requirements mandated by OMB\nTo help agencies more effectively use available logs to detect and remediate cyber threats, CISA has developed a new Expanded Cloud Log Implementation Playbook in close coordination with Microsoft, which provides further detail on each newly available log and how these logs can be used to support threat hunting and incident-response operations.\n“Last summer, we were glad to see Microsoft’s commitment to make necessary logging available to federal agencies and the broader cybersecurity community. I am pleased that we have made real progress toward this goal,” said\nCISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Eric Goldstein\n. “We look forward to continued progress with our partners to ensure that every organization has access to necessary security logs– a core tenet of our Secure by Design guidance in support of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. Every organization has the right to safe and secure technology, and we continue to make progress toward this goal.”\n“As the federal government continues our transition to cloud environments, we must ensure we are following secure-by-design and secure-by-default principles,” said\nChris DeRusha, Federal Chief Information Security Officer and Deputy National Cyber Director\n. “The upgraded logging features now available to Microsoft’s government community cloud customers will provide greater visibility, and enable our network defenders to enhance their threat detection capabilities.”\n“We recognize the vital importance that advanced logging plays in enabling federal agencies to detect, respond to, and prevent even the most sophisticated cyberattacks from well-resourced, state-sponsored actors. For this reason, we have been collaborating across the federal government to provide access to advanced audit logs,” said\nCandice Ling, Senior Vice President, Microsoft Federal.\n“Microsoft will continue to play a critical role in partnering with the federal government to reinforce our commitment to secure by design and further enhance the security baseline of our nation.”\n, a federal agency observed suspicious, unexpected activity in unclassified Microsoft 365 audit logs and reported it to Microsoft and CISA. The agency detected the activity using one of the logs Microsoft is expanding access to with this announcement. The importance of having critical cybersecurity logs that provided timely information was clearly demonstrated by this incident. CISA continues our work to ensure every organization has access to key security data by default so they can better defend their networks from malicious cyber actors.\nFor more details on this announcement, read\nwebpage for more information.\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

Since mail is a key component of both standard office operations and mail balloting across the country, this guidance document provides information for election offices on how to identify and handle potentially suspicious mail and respond to potential hazardous materials exposure while handling suspicious mail. The guide also provides specific information on how to protect against the three hazardous powders of greatest concern, fentanyl, anthrax, and ricin, in addition to more routine mail hazards.\n“CISA is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with state and local election officials who face a complex threat environment,”\nsaid CISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “Today’s guidance on safe mail handling procedures will help election officials and others on the frontlines of our democracy take steps to protect themselves and their personnel from hazards sent through the mail.  We will continue to work with our partners to ensure election officials have the information and resources they need to run a safe, secure and resilient election.”\n“It is essential for the FBI to leverage force multipliers, through strong partnerships and informational campaigns, like this one, which focus on election mail handling procedures,\" said\nSusan Ferensic, Assistant Director of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate.\n\"This guidance will further strengthen the ability of those on the frontlines to be better prepared to identify and handle suspicious mail. The FBI will continue to reinforce proactive partnerships in an effort to protect election workers.”\nEAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks\nsaid in the following joint statement: “The safety of election workers is a top priority for the EAC, as it should be for all Americans. To ensure our elections run smoothly, election officials must be able to carry out essential tasks such as opening and receiving mail without risking their health. Due to the multiple incidents involving election offices being sent hazardous materials, we urge election workers to exercise caution when handling mail by following the guidance in this resource. We will continue to work with federal partners to support officials as they conduct fair, safe, and secure elections in 2024 and beyond.”\n“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to ensuring the safe and secure delivery of Election Mail, the integrity of our elections and the protection of election offices and election officials from threatening and dangerous mail,” said\nGary Barksdale, Chief Postal Inspector\n.  “This guidance is part of our collaborative efforts with our federal partners to raise awareness with the election community of suspicious, threatening, and dangerous mail and steps that can be taken to prepare for, and respond to, these incidents should they arise.  We encourage all election offices to implement the recommendations that are part of this guidance.”\nElection Mail Handling Procedures to Protect Against Hazardous Materials\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nStatement from CISA Director Easterly on the Security of the 2024 Elections\nJoint Statement from CISA and EAC in Support of State and Local Election Officials\nCISA Launches #PROTECT2024 Election Threat Updates Webpage\nCISA and USPIS Release Two Election Mail Security Resources",

      "content": "Reflecting on the Parkland tragedy, its lasting impacts, and work still to be done\nJen Easterly, Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\nToday marks six years since 17 students and faculty senselessly lost their lives and 17 others were injured when a mass murderer entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and started shooting. Since that horrific day, 124 more Americans have been killed and 331 injured on campuses across the country in 189 separate school shootings—almost 3 shootings a month since Parkland. This is simply unacceptable, and it must stop.\nThe referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.\nLast month, I joined Education Secretary Cardona to not only remember, but also to walk in the shoes of those who lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building 1200. I had the privilege of talking with the parents of Alex Schachter, Gina Montalto, Luke Hoyer, Jaime Guttenberg, and Alyssa Alhadeff, beautiful students with the brightest of futures ahead of them, and Debbi Hixon, the wife of Athletic Director Chris Hixon, who gave his life rushing into the building to save hundreds of students that day.\nWith daunting courage and grace, the families of these victims have turned one of the most devastating and traumatic experiences imaginable into action. They founded organizations, such as Stand with Parkland, Safe Schools for Alex, Make Our Schools Safe, and Orange Ribbons for Jaime and have tirelessly worked with everyone from the local school district, the district attorney, law enforcement, state and local officials, and the federal government to not only raise awareness of school safety, but also to make our schools safer.\nAnd while there have been notable improvements since the Parkland tragedy, the work continues. My visit reinforced my belief that every student and educator has the right to learn and teach in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from any threat of violence. CISA, in collaboration with families of the Parkland victims, took action to formalize and strengthen our commitment to school safety in the wake of the tragedy by establishing the School Safety Task Force (SSTF) in 2019, our dedicated school safety program that creates resources and products to address the most pressing issues and threats confronting K-12 communities. Through our SSTF, we manage the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse, an interagency collaboration among the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; and Justice that bring the full resources from across the federal government together to strengthen the security of our nation’s schools.\nAs part of our work with the Clearinghouse, we manage\n, a comprehensive repository of more than 600 federal and state resources, programs, tools, evidence-based practices, and actionable recommendations across key school safety topics. A lot of our discussion while visiting Parkland was around building\nwithin our schools and local communities—a key focus of the resources available on the website.\nSchool safety is not just the job of school administrators or school resource officers. We need to be thinking about how we can truly empower and engage all members of the community in safety efforts—creating positive, safe, and trusting environments; improving school physical security measures; providing appropriate training on emergency procedures and protocols; increasing mental health supports and resources; and implementing trauma-informed approaches to the educational setting.\nBeing in Parkland and hearing from students and faculty who were there that day and who live with the experience day in and day out underscored how important a school culture is that empowers students to come forward if they have concerns about safety. When schools are made aware of these potential threats, they can effectively intervene with the appropriate resources and support. To help schools create these cultures, CISA partnered with the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center to develop the\nK-12 Bystander Reporting Toolkit\n. This toolkit, which was released last May, offers simple strategies and guidance K-12 schools can use to implement and enhance safety reporting programs and encourage bystander reporting.\nWe’ve also focused on the physical security of our nation’s schools. We’ve developed evidence-based tools that K-12 schools can use to evaluate and improve physical security. The\nK-12 School Security Guide Product Suite\nhelps schools assess their unique needs and identify and prioritize actions to bolster physical security. This approach brings together different parts of school security that had traditionally been siloed to detect, delay, and respond to threats and risks so there is no single point of failure. CISA’s subject matter experts in the field – our Protective Security Advisors – are also available to help schools assess their security vulnerabilities and come up with a plan to be better prepared for emergencies.\nFinally, during a roundtable after our walkthrough of the school, we talked about the impact that financial resources can have on the security posture of a school. However, the grants landscape can be difficult to navigate. To help schools locate and access the federal funding that’s available to them, SchoolSafety.gov developed the\n. This tool compiles and organizes existing federal school safety-related grants in one centralized location and provides direction to help schools find the grant programs most relevant or applicable to their individual needs.\nMy visit to Parkland had a profound impact on me as a parent, as a public servant, and as a member of the broader school safety community; I will carry this experience and these conversations with me for the rest of my life.\nTo those impacted by school violence, we honor the memories of your loved ones tragically taken too soon, and we stand in partnership with you to ensure that families and communities across our country do not have to endure this pain and loss ever again.\nTo the survivors and the families that lost loved ones at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School six years ago today: we remain inspired and deeply moved by your actions, and by your efforts to turn your pain into progress and purpose. We are also grateful to the dedicated state and local officials for the invaluable on-the-ground work you do on the front lines of school safety. We are honored to work side-by-side with you for a safer and more secure nation.\nAs I reflect on all that we’ve accomplished in the six years since the Parkland tragedy, I also recognize that we have much, much more to do. The whole of CISA is steadfast in its commitment to making K-12 schools safer and more secure each day.\nSupporting Safe and Secure K-12 Schools\nFindings and Updates from CISA’s Ongoing Collaboration with Education Technology Vendors to Address K-12 Cybersecurity Challenges\nCISA Resources to Help Schools Strengthen Security and Build Resilience\nBack to School Safety: Resources to Support Our Nation’s Students and Schools",

      "author": "Clayton Romans, Associate Director\n\n\n Related topics: \n\nCybersecurity Best Practices \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, we established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to bring together industry and government partners with new and challenging goals: enable persistent, trusted partnerships that address the most urgent current risks, and drive long-term, proactive planning. This second goal was particularly unique; never before had the U.S. government sought to engage in joint planning with the private sector around shared cybersecurity challenges. We’ve learned a lot over the past few years as we successfully executed a series of cyber defense plans. These include securing open source software in operational technology and industrial control systems, addressing risks facing remote monitoring and management, and enhancing security and incident response for the water sector, as well as gleaning valuable lessons on how to make our planning efforts valuable for each of our partners.Today, we’re glad to publish our 2024 Priorities. These priorities will further expand the breadth and depth of our partnership to tackle more challenging, forward-leaning cyber risks that could evolve in the future, not just the immediate risks. To be clear, JCDC in this context is not a specific team or organization; it represents the collective group of industry and government partners drawn together to drive positive change for our nation’s cybersecurity.Our 2024 priorities are defined around three focus areas. The first focus area, Defend Against Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Operations, aligns JCDC strategic and operational efforts to counter known and suspected APT campaigns that target critical infrastructure sectors with the potential to impact National Critical Functions. The second focus area, Raise the Baseline, encompasses JCDC efforts to improve the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure entities to reduce the frequency and impact of cyber incidents. The third focus area, Anticipate Emerging Technology and Risks, seeks to decrease the likelihood and impact of AI-related threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure providers.Six 2024 JCDC priorities, aligned with the three focus areas, call out specific topics for increased attention.  JCDC’s Priorities for 2024 are:Discover and defend against malicious abuse by APT actors, particularly those backed by the PRC, on and against U.S.-based infrastructure. In 2023, we saw an increase in APT activity, particularly APT groups affiliated with the People’s Republic of China, directed towards the critical infrastructure on which Americans depend. In 2024, JCDC will work with interagency and private sector partners to strengthen the ability of critical infrastructure sector organizations to prepare for and respond to future malicious activity on their networks, including activity utilizing living off the land techniques.Prepare for major cyber incidents. JCDC will work to elevate critical infrastructure's capacity for resiliency and capability for recovery in response to major cyber incidents. This includes supporting CISA’s work to update the National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP). As directed by the President’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy, CISA, in close coordination with the Office of the National Cyber Director, is gathering input from public and private sector partners to identify key changes for incorporation into the updated NCIRP. Through JCDC, CISA is working to ensure this process addresses significant changes in policy and cyber operations since the NCIRP was released and plans to publish an updated NCIRP this year.Help provide state and local election officials with information and tools to help secure their networks and infrastructure against cyber threats as part of CISA’s broader election security efforts. JCDC will support CISA’s effort to improve the security, visibility, and resiliency of the election security ecosystem by collaborating, planning, and sharing cyber threat information withJCDC industry partners, interagency partners, SLTT entities, and vendors across the elections community.Measurably decrease the impact of ransomware on critical infrastructure. The impacts of ransomware and data extortion have proven challenging and costly for organizations of all sizes. JCDC will leverage its resources and engage with partners to prioritize operational activities that actively defend against and disrupt ransomware campaigns in collaboration with government and non-governmental entities. We will also collaborate with technology providers to leverage Secure by Design principles to scale protection.Make measurable progress toward a world where technology is Secure by Design. Even as we urgently work to help organizations implement the most effective cybersecurity measures, we know that scalable change requires a fundamental shift in how technology is designed, built, and maintained. We will continue to drive measurable commitments across the technology ecosystem that reduce the number of defective technology products by design and ensure that strong default settings are the norm. In 2023, CISA announced our Secure by Design Alert series to identify recurring classes of defects that can be fixed through systemic changes. In 2024 we will continue to publish these alerts, including those developed in response to other priorities, such as discovering malicious abuse by APT actors. Decrease risk posed by AI to critical infrastructure. In alignment and coordination with CISA’s Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, JCDC will support CISA and DHS-led efforts to decrease the likelihood and impact of AI-related threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure providers.I am incredibly proud of this collaborative team and what we have accomplished, overcoming many obstacles to meet the demands of the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. Through JCDC, CISA looks forward to furthering this work with our partners across government and private sector to tackle some of the most significant cyber risks facing our country in 2024.JCDC is a public-private cybersecurity collaborative that leverages new authorities granted by Congress in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to unite the global cyber community in the collective defense of cyberspace.

This second goal was particularly unique; never before had the U.S. government sought to engage in joint planning with the private sector around shared cybersecurity challenges. We’ve learned a lot over the past few years as we successfully executed a series of cyber defense plans. These include securing open source software in operational technology and industrial control systems, addressing risks facing remote monitoring and management, and enhancing security and incident response for the water sector, as well as gleaning valuable lessons on how to make our planning efforts valuable for each of our partners.\nToday, we’re glad to publish our\n. These priorities will further expand the breadth and depth of our partnership to tackle more challenging, forward-leaning cyber risks that could evolve in the future, not just the immediate risks. To be clear, JCDC in this context is not a specific team or organization; it represents the collective group of industry and government partners drawn together to drive positive change for our nation’s cybersecurity.\nOur 2024 priorities are defined around\n. The first focus area,\nDefend Against Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Operations\n, aligns JCDC strategic and operational efforts to counter known and suspected APT campaigns that target\ncritical infrastructure sectors\nwith the potential to impact\nNational Critical Functions\n.

The owner of Las Vegas event planning company Fnom Worldwide said she was most interested in learning how to better protect her personal and her clients’ data.\n“I got some great tips and information from the presentation, and I really appreciate that (CISA’s) services are free,” Burbank said.  She admits that she was not aware of CISA prior to Acosta’s presentation. Her next step? Request a cyber vulnerability scan for her business from Acosta.\nBurbank was one of more than 200 local small businesses in Las Vegas who attended the cybersecurity workshop as part of the Super Bowl Business Connect program. The program, which is sponsored by the National Football League and the Las Vegas Super Bowl LVIII Host Committee, aims to link diverse suppliers to contracting opportunities related to Super Bowl LVIII and to provide professional networking and development programming for program participants.\n“One of the goals of the Business Connect program is to make sure that these businesses are prepared to do business with the NFL and that is no small feat,” said Myisha Boyce, Chief Community Engagement Officer for the Las Vegas Super Bowl LVIII Host Committee. “So, one of the things that is critical is the security and safety of the information of these businesses.”\nJackie Stevenson, owner of the Sharp BBQ food truck, called Acosta’s presentation “eye-opening” when he learned how often cyberattacks occur and how costly they can be. Having been hacked in the past, he now vows to implement multi-factor authentication and to change his password.\nFollowing cybersecurity presentations from CISA, UNLV, Cisco and AWS, attendees had the opportunity to network with representatives from 30 local corporations to discuss procurement needs during the Super Bowl and beyond.\nCISA’s participation in the Business Connect program is just one example of the numerous activities that the agency has engaged in leading up to Sunday’s Super Bowl game.\nPhoto Caption: CISA Region 9 Supervisory Cybersecurity Advisor May Acosta offers tips to small business owners on how to protect their companies from cyberattacks at the SB LVIII Small Business Summit in Las Vegas.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

This product provides a baseline Framework for organizations to consider when building their own HBOM. The Framework includes a consistent naming methodology for attributes of components, a format for identifying and providing information about the different types of components, and guidance of what HBOM information is appropriate depending on the purpose for which the HBOM will be used.\n“As threats to the global ICT supply chain have become increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, solutions that leverage public and private expertise are critical. The Task Force was established several years ago as the preeminent public-private partnership for developing actionable tools to address our most pressing supply chain issues,” said\nITI Vice President of Policy and Senior Counsel and IT Sector Co-Chair of the Task Force John Miller\n. “To that end, the Task Force recently stood up an Artificial Intelligence Working Group to identify AI related supply chain risks and mitigations. We welcome the renewal of the Task Force charter and continuing our important work to address our shared supply chain risk management challenges.”\n“Supply chain attacks on our global ICT infrastructure have become more frequent, aggressive, and increasingly consequential. Throughout the last several years, the critical work that the Task Force developed has provided profound support for our public and private sector stakeholders in terms of mitigating supply chain risks,” said\nUS Telecom Senior Vice President, Cybersecurity and Innovation, and Communications Sector Task Force Co-Chair Robert Mayer\nThe renewal of the Task Force will allow working groups to continue the development of valuable products such as the Software Assurance Buyers Guide and continue work related to the newly formed Artificial Intelligence (AI) working group. The AI working group seeks to identify beneficial ways in which AI can be used to mitigate threats posed to ICT SCRM processes. Additionally, the Task Force will be hosting its first annual ICT SCRM Task Force Conference. The charter renewal will also ensure that both government and industry members can continue to collaborate on other ongoing public-private engagement efforts around supply chain.\nIn the next two years, through January 2026, the Task Force will continue to explore means for building and strengthening partnerships with stakeholders who can help grow the applicability and utilization of Task Force products, tools, and resources to better manage risks facing the ICT supply chain. With the interconnectedness between the sectors and the scale of supply chain risks faced by both government and industry, private-public coordination is essential to enhance ICT supply chain resilience.\nFor more information, please visit:\nICT Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force | CISA\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nCISA Releases Software Acquisition Guide for Government Enterprise Consumers: Software Assurance in the Cyber-Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Lifecycle\nCISA Hosts First Annual Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force Conference\nCISA Releases New Resource to Help Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Develop Supply Chain Resilience Plans\nCISA Releases Hardware Bill of Materials Framework (HBOM) for Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)",

Attendees included 911 administrators, representatives from local centers and IT/cyber communities, and Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (SWICs) from each state and territory. CISA's collaboration history with SWICs is crucial for enhancing nationwide interoperability and strengthening stakeholder relationships, especially in emergency communication systems like 911. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA) partnered with CISA to engage stakeholders to determine cybersecurity priorities for the CR911 Program.\nAt the symposium, speakers and panelists presented an overview of the current cyber threat landscape and shared resources to help enhance the cybersecurity posture of Emergency Communication Centers (ECCs). Symposium topics included the current state of cyber resilience in the 911 ecosystem, best practices for responding to a cyberattack and the available program resources for each region. CISA facilitators utilized interactive live polling, breakout sessions and group discussions to gather stakeholders’ current needs, concerns and capability gaps with regards to cybersecurity. Attendees also participated in a tabletop discussion focused on a simulated cyberattack scenario.\nBilly Bob Brown, Jr., Executive Assistant Director of CISA’s ECD, shared this sentiment following the success of the program’s second symposium, “We are grateful to all our 911 stakeholders, esteemed partners at NHTSA, NTIA, and FCC, as well as speakers from other CISA divisions, state, local and federal entities, for joining us and making the program’s second symposium a resounding success. Each region offers an invaluable perspective for their state and local communities. Listening to their challenges and feedback has been instrumental in helping CISA understand what it takes to truly build a secure and resilient 911 ecosystem that is capable of strengthening our nation’s ECCs against evolving cyber threats.\"\nCISA will continue its efforts to reach 911 stakeholders in Spring 2024 and plans to host two additional symposiums in the Western and Central regions. CISA will use the findings from each symposium to help determine how to better serve the 911 community’s cybersecurity needs. This symposium brings CISA one step closer to achieving its vision to:\nEmpower the nation’s 911 communities to defend their critical infrastructure against cyber threats through the design and implementation of a secure and resilient 911 ecosystem.\nCISA, SAFECOM and NCSWIC Publish SAFECOM Guidance on Emergency Communications Grants\nCISA Launches Tribal Affairs Webpage\nSAFECOM Releases the Emergency Communications System Lifecycle Planning Guide Suite Refresh\nSAFECOM and National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (NCSWIC) develop Artificial Intelligence in Emergency Communications Centers Infographic",

      "content": "Opening Statement by CISA Director Jen Easterly\nBefore the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States\nand the Chinese Communist Party\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nChairman Gallagher, Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi, Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on CISA’s efforts to protect the Nation from the preeminent cyber threat posed by the People’s Republic of China.\nAs America’s civilian cyber defense agency and the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA has long been focused on cyber threats from China. In recent years, however, we have observed a deeply concerning evolution in Chinese targeting of US infrastructure.\nSpecifically, Chinese cyber actors, including a group known as “Volt Typhoon,” are burrowing deep into our critical infrastructure to be ready to launch destructive cyber-attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States. This is a world where a major conflict halfway around the globe might well endanger the American people here at home through the disruption of our gas pipelines; the pollution of our water facilities; the severing of our telecommunications; the crippling of our transportation systems—all designed to incite chaos and panic across our country and deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will.\nThis threat is not theoretical: leveraging information from our government and industry partners, CISA teams have found and eradicated Chinese intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors, including aviation, energy, water, and telecommunications. And what we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg. Given the malicious activity uncovered by CISA, NSA, FBI, and industry partners, we are acting now, knowing that this threat is both real and urgent.\nFirst, through authorities provided by Congress based a recommendation from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, we are using the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative or JCDC to drive robust operational collaboration across government and industry focused on uncovering additional Chinese malicious cyber activity and developing new ways to prevent Chinese intrusions. Second, we are delivering services, guidance, and resources to critical infrastructure owners and operators across the nation to identify and reduce risks posed by Chinese cyber actors. And we are leveraging our now hundreds of advisors and subject matter experts across the country to work directly with critical infrastructure businesses to strengthen the resilience of the critical services Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nThe reality is, however, eradicating malicious Chinese activity, bolstering the resilience of critical infrastructure, or even going on the offense to disrupt and impose costs, are all necessary, but insufficient. While the PRC is a sophisticated cyber adversary, many of its methods to break into our critical infrastructure are not. They don’t have to be. Why? Because we’ve made it easy for them. The truth is that, in many cases, the PRC is taking advantage of known product defects.\nUnfortunately, the technology base underpinning much of our critical infrastructure is inherently insecure, because for decades *\nhave been insulated from responsibility for defects in their products. This has led to misaligned incentives that prioritize features and speed to market over security, leaving our nation vulnerable to cyber invasion. That must stop. Technology companies must help ensure that China and other cyber actors cannot exploit defects in technology products to saunter into the open doors of our critical infrastructure to prepare destructive attacks. They must build and deliver products that are secure by design.\nWe are at a critical juncture for our national security. Today’s hearing should serve as an urgent call to collective action. Specifically:\nEvery victim of a cyber incident should report it to CISA or FBI, every time, recognizing that a threat to one is a threat to many, because cybersecurity is national security.\nEvery critical infrastructure entity should establish a relationship with their local CISA team and enroll in our free services, particularly our Vulnerability Scanning program, to help identify and repair vulnerabilities being exploited by Chinese cyber actors.\nEvery critical infrastructure entity should use these services, along with CISA’s Cybersecurity Performance Goals, and the many advisories we’ve published with NSA and FBI to drive necessary investment in cyber hygiene, including throughout their supply chains.\nEvery critical infrastructure entity should double down on their commitment to resilience. They must expect and prepare for an attack, continually testing and exercising the continuity of critical systems to ensure they can operate through disruption and recover rapidly to continue to provide services to the American people.\nFinally, every technology manufacturer must build, test, and ship products that are secure by design. We must drive toward a future where defects in our technology products are a shocking anomaly, a future underpinned by a software liability regime based on a measurable standard of care and safe harbor provisions for software developers who do responsibly innovate by prioritizing security.\nThese steps, however, are only achievable if CEOs, Boards, and every single business leader of a critical infrastructure organization treats cyber risks as core business risks and recognize that managing them is a matter of both good governance and fundamental national security.\nThank you. I look forward to your questions.\nAs called for in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, we must shift incentives so that\ninvest in producing technology that is secure by design, taking care not to place the burden on end users or individual developers*.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption",

      "content": "SAFECOM Membership Spotlight: Major Darryl Anderson, SAFECOM At-Large (Stark County Sheriff’s Office)\nAuthor: Wes Rogers, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Darryl Anderson, SAFECOM At-Large, Stark County Sheriff’s Office\nEmergency Communications\nSAFECOM, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) premier public safety communications advisory council, is made-up of public safety stakeholders with a diverse set of experiences and backgrounds. Major Darryl Anderson, of Stark County Sheriff’s Office, offered to share some of his insights about SAFECOM and the direction of the public safety communications community.\nDarryl Anderson was an Ohio State Trooper for 31 years, from 1970 - 2001. He retired with the rank of Major, and last served as the Commander of the Ohio State Highway Patrol Training Academy. Immediately prior to that assignment, he was in charge of the Office of Technology, where he served as one of the primary architects of what would become the Ohio Multiple Agency Radio Communications System (MARCS). In July 2001 he retired from the Patrol and became the MARCS Project Manager, overseeing the build out and deployment of the original statewide 800 MHz voice and data platform. He founded Ohio’s Statewide Interoperability Executive Committee (SIEC) and became the first Ohio Statewide Interoperability Coordinator (SWIC) and Single Point of Contact. He also served as a Deputy Sheriff in Pickaway County, Ohio in his spare time!\nIn 2010, he led the development of the state’s migration to the current Project 25, 700/800 MARCS platform, now supporting over 150,000 radios! He retired from state service in 2015 and shortly thereafter went to work for Sheriff George T. Maier of Stark County, where he assisted the Sheriff and the Stark County Commissioners in the design, procurement and build out of a MARCS “Super Cell”. Stark/MARCS now supports virtually all Stark County first responders with countywide in-building coverage, ensuring seamless interoperability for all emergency personnel. Sheriff Maier presented Major Anderson with the 2022 George Papodopulos award for his diligent work with the Stark/MARCS system, the recently activated Jail Management System, and his continuous work on the countywide law enforcement Records Management System.\nCISA: What drew you to joining SAFECOM and what is your role as a SAFECOM member?\nAnswer: I served as Ohio’s SWIC from the inception of the position until my retirement from the State in 2015. In the role, I routinely and continuously interacted with SAFECOM members and became keenly aware of the benefits of SAFECOM’s collective wisdom as we move forward with Public Safety Mission Critical Communications. Admiral Hewitt approached me and asked me to join SAFECOM as a Member-at-Large. I jumped at the chance! I believe my primary role with SAFECOM is to ensure the voice of the first responder “At the Tip of the Spear” is always heard as we work continuously toward improving public safety communications!\nCISA: What projects at SAFECOM are you currently working on and what projects are you most excited for?\nAnswer: I am on the Funding and Sustainment Committee and know full well the importance (and oft-times overlooked!) of both initial funding of communications projects, and even more important (and more overlooked!!) the continued funding of systems once in place. I firmly believe one of the huge benefits of SAFECOM is the ongoing communications best practices SAFECOM provides. System managers do not need to “reinvent the wheel” as new projects are planned and implemented. SAFECOM provides ongoing guidance for communication leaders nationwide. This is exciting! The emerging Land Mobile Radios/Long Term Evolution “Seamless Roaming” capability is very exciting!!\nCISA: What do you want those who may not know about SAFECOM to know about the program?\nAnswer: SAFECOM is (tangentially) from the government and we are here to help!!! The experience and knowledge of our individual and collective membership, supported by CISA, stands ready, willing, and able to provide assistance to public safety communications managers and practitioners at all levels. The perusal of the SAFECOM website will assist the inquirer to find the proper resources needed to solve challenges many face for the first time. Every time I have approached CISA, as either a practitioner or a SAFECOM member, with an issue I needed help with, I came away with solid potential solutions and/or individual contacts.\nCISA: Tell us about your experience working in the public safety community. How has the communications landscape changed over the years? How do you see the landscape changing over the next few years?\nAnswer: When I first hit the road as a trooper in early 1971, our radio technology was a 4-channel, low-band in-car radio that worked, most of the time. We did not have portable radios until 1978, so when we exited our patrol car we had no “lifeline”! It was not until the trunked digital technology emerged in the early 1990’s that we could roll out a wide-area radio system that could be relied on to work consistently. Today, if our deputy’s’ radio does not affiliate with their backbone system, it is cause for great alarm (and rarely, if EVER happens!). Progress!\nI believe the emergence of Next Generation 911 (NG-911) will greatly enhance officer situational awareness in the next few years as real-time video information becomes available to the dispatch center and relayed to the first responder. Also, real-time viewing of officer’s in-car and bodycams will allow for great officer safety and support.\nCISA: Do you think SAFECOM will continue to grow and develop in the next couple of years to better help local, tribal, state, territorial and federal agencies?\nAnswer: Yes, it is our mission! As long as SAFECOM continues to network, stay informed, and create best practices, and seek out energetic membership, we cannot fail!\nCISA: How has your involvement in SAFECOM impacted both your community and the public safety community as a whole?\nAnswer: By staying involved in what is developing nationwide, by networking with both SAFECOM membership and National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators membership, we all benefit when we implement new ideas and best practices mined through these networking opportunities. The ongoing support and assistance that CISA provides to all levels of government is laudable!\nCISA: Where do you see the communications landscape in the next 5-10 years?\nAnswer: As previously mentioned, NG-911 will provide both the dispatch centers and the on-scene first responder with more real time information. FirstNet and other cellular providers will continue to get more robust and provide additional data and other tools. The current and next generation of public safety personnel are “digital natives” and will bring new perspectives to our leadership as they advance through the ranks.

      "content": "We Must Consider Software Developers a Key Part of the Cybersecurity Workforce\nBy: Jack Cable, Senior Technical Advisor, CISA\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nFour and a half years ago, as a student studying computer science, I wrote in the\nHarvard Business Review\nwhat at the time felt like a simple observation: I didn’t need to take a cybersecurity class to graduate, and neither did my peers at 23 of the top 24 universities in computer science.\nIt’s now 2024, and after seeing\nbrazen ransomware attacks ever\ncyberattacks on the federal government by nation-state adversaries over the past few years, cybersecurity in computer science education remains an elective. Indeed, that list of the top 24 universities in computer science hasn’t changed: 23 still don’t require cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is viewed as a subdiscipline, much like graphics or human-computer interaction – not essential knowledge that every future software developer should be equipped with as they enter the workforce. This is unacceptable. All too often, attacks exploit simple weaknesses that any developer with basic security knowledge could have stopped.\nIt is long overdue for academia to reconsider their role in producing a software developer workforce that enables increasingly damaging cyberattacks\n. As long as cybersecurity remains an elective, too many software developers will lack even a basic understanding about security and will continue prioritize speed to market over the security and safety of their customers.\nThe truth is that what we traditionally view as the cybersecurity workforce alone will not fundamentally change the state of cybersecurity\n. To foster long-term cybersecurity, we must ensure that software developers and business leaders can build in security from the onset.\nIn March 2023, the White House issued the\nNational Cybersecurity Strategy\ncalling for a fundamental shift in accountability from those least capable—like individuals and small businesses—onto those most capable, namely technology manufacturers. The White House’s follow-on\nNational Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy\ndirectly acknowledges the need for security knowledge in software development, stating “participants in the software development process—from business leaders to software developers and product managers—must be equipped to manage the security and privacy implications of the software they create.”\ncampaign aims to fulfill the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s vision by highlighting areas where various stakeholders, including software manufacturers and academia, can act. Software manufacturers in particular must adopt the core principles outlined in our\nSecure by Design whitepaper\nto improve our nation’s cybersecurity.\nThese principles must also be advanced in academia. In September, we hosted a workshop at the National Cybersecurity Education Colloquium (NCEC) focused on identifying challenges in weaving security into computer science curriculums. We identified the following key issues during this interactive roundtable discussion with computer science and cybersecurity educators:\nSecurity is treated as an elective\n. The prevailing attitude of the computer science field is that security is a subdiscipline, not a fundamental area of knowledge. As such, security knowledge is only seen as needed for students who show particular interest or seek further degrees in research.\nLimited resources and experience among faculty\n. This generation of computer science faculty was trained in the same system, so it’s not surprising there is a lack of security knowledge. That fact, coupled with a lack of standardized security education materials and a limited desire among faculty means integrating security into curriculums is challenging.\nLack of a demand signal by industry\n. Universities want to produce graduates who are employable. To date, companies have not expressed that security is one of the key factors they evaluate when hiring software developers. Until that changes, universities have little incentive to change their practices.\nWorkshop participants also identified several potential solutions to these challenges, including integrating security requirements into the accreditation process for computer science programs, and increased availability of computer science curriculum materials.\nAt CISA, we’re continuing to drive the mission of making software\n. We’re exploring ways of integrating security requirements for schools to be designated/redesignated as a NSA/CISA National\nCenter of Academic Excellence\n. We are also engaging with educators from the K-12 level to universities and other software development education platforms to further integrate security into their curricula. And, we are working across academia and industry to further establish cross-disciplinary education for both computer science and cybersecurity professionals to better integrate security in the earliest stages of product development. CISA will publish future blogs on these topics as they mature.\nWe have a path forward, but we’d love additional thoughts on how we can best achieve a future that’s secure by design. In December, CISA released a\nRequest for Information\n(RFI) seeking your feedback on the role of security in computer science education, with responses due February 20\n.

This Emergency Directive directs all federal civilian agencies to immediately take specific actions and implement vendor mitigation guidance to these Ivanti appliances. While only binding on Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, CISA urges all organizations using these products to urgently implement the mitigations outlined in this Directive.\nLast week, Ivanti released information regarding two vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, that allow an attacker to move laterally across a target network, perform data exfiltration, and establish persistent system access. CISA has determined an Emergency Directive is necessary based on the widespread exploitation of these vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors, prevalence of the affected products in the federal enterprise, high potential for compromise of agency information systems, and potential impact of a successful compromise.\n“The vulnerabilities in these products pose significant, unacceptable risks to the security of the federal civilian enterprise. As America’s cyber defense agency and the operational lead for federal civilian cybersecurity, we must take urgent action to reduce risks to the federal systems upon which Americans depend,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly\n. “Even as federal agencies take urgent action in response to this Directive, we know that these risks extend to every organization and sector using these products. We strongly urge all organizations to adopt the actions outlined in this Directive.”\nAs federal civilian agencies implement this mandate, CISA will assess and support agency adherence and provide additional resources as required. CISA is committed to using its cybersecurity authorities to gain greater visibility and drive timely risk reduction across federal civilian agencies.\nFor more information CISA Directives, visit\nCybersecurity Directives\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team\nCISA Publishes Microsoft Expanded Cloud Log Implementation Playbook\nCISA Releases Plan to Align Operational Cybersecurity Priorities for Federal Agencies",

Technical expertise is not required to understand and use this guide.\nDeveloped in collaboration with over 25 WWS Sector industry, nonprofit, and state/local government partners, this resource covers the four stages of the incident response lifecycle:\n: WWS Sector organizations should have an incident response plan in place, implement available services and resources to raise their cyber baseline, and engage with the WWS Sector cyber community.\nDetection and analysis\n: Accurate and timely reporting and rapid collective analysis are essential to understand the full scope and impact of a cyber incident. The guidance provides information on validating an incident, reporting levels, and available technical analysis and support.\nContainment, eradication, and recovery\n: While WWS Sector utilities are conducting their incident response plan, federal partners are focusing on coordinated messaging and information sharing, and remediation and mitigation assistance.\nPost-incident activities\n. Evidence retention, using collected incident data, and lessons learned are the overarching elements for a proper analysis of both the incident and how responders handled it.\n“The Water and Wastewater Systems sector is under constant threat from malicious cyber actors. This timely and actionable guidance reflects an outstanding partnership between industry, nonprofit, and government partners that came together with EPA, FBI and CISA to support this essential sector. We encourage every WWS entity to review this joint guide and implement its recommended actions,” said\nCISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity, Eric Goldstein\n. “In the new year, CISA will continue to focus on taking every action possible to support ‘target-rich, cyber-poor’ entities like WWS utilities by providing actionable resources and encouraging all organizations to report cyber incidents. Our regional team members across the country will continue to engage with WWS partners to provide access to CISA’s voluntary services, such as enrollment in our Vulnerability Scanning, and serve as a resource for continued improvement.”\n\"The Water and Wastewater Systems Sector is a vital part of our critical infrastructure, and the FBI will continue to combat cyber actors who threaten it,” said\nAssistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division\n. “A key part of our cyber strategy is building strong partnerships and sharing threat information with the owners and operators of critical infrastructure before they are hit with an attack.”\n“Cyber threats to the water sector represent a real and urgent risk to safe drinking water and wastewater services that our nation relies on. The incident response guide assists utilities with approaches for collaboration with federal entities on lowering cyber risk in our nation’s drinking water and wastewater systems,” said\nEPA Assistant Administrator for Water, Radhika Fox\n. “EPA is committed to working with our federal, state, and water sector partners to increase the sector’s resilience and improve cyber-resilience practices.”\nAll WWS utilities are encouraged to use this incident response guide to augment their incident response planning and collaboration with federal partners and the WWS before, during, and following a cyber incident. Familiarity with this guide will better prepare WWS utilities to respond to—and recover from—a cyber incident.\nFor more information and resources, WWS utilities are encouraged to visit CISA’s\nWater and Wastewater Systems Cybersecurity\nPartners that contributed to this guide include:\nAssociation of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA)\nCenter on Cyber and Technology Innovation (CCTI)\nCyber Readiness Institute (CRI)\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis\nDistrict of Columbia Water (DC Water)\nEast Bay Municipal Utility District\nInternational Society of Automation (ISA)\nMaine DHHS CDC Drinking Water Program\nNew Jersey Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC)\nPlatte Canyon Water & Sanitation DistrictSan Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC)\nTrinity River Authority of Texas\nWater Environment Federation\nWater Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC)\nIndividuals from American Water Works Association (AWWA)\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\n2024 Year in Review Highlights CISA’s Achievements in Reducing Risk and Building Resilience in Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Security\nCISA Releases 2023 Year in Review Showcasing Efforts to Protect Critical Infrastructure\nCISA Releases Key Risk and Vulnerability Findings for Healthcare and Public Health Sector",

The 2023 Year in Review reflects on the agency’s accomplishments across its broad cybersecurity, infrastructure security and emergency communications missions as the nation and the world adapted to technological advances, spillover from international events and other major events. In 2024, CISA will continue to develop and deliver tools, training, technical expertise and other resources to help our critical infrastructure partners increase their own resilience and defenses against evolving risks.\n“This Year in Review report demonstrates CISA’s exceptional work in 2023 to protect critical infrastructure,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “It not only celebrates our progress from the past year but also spotlights groundbreaking milestones and pioneering ‘firsts’ achieved by the agency. These efforts are a testament to and reflect the dedication of CISA’s workforce. Because of their commitment to the mission, the critical infrastructure systems that Americans rely on every day are more secure and resilient than ever.”\nIn 2023, the CISA accomplishments included:\nPromoting Secure by Design Principles.\nAs part of an Administration-wide push to promote secure software development, CISA launched its\ncampaign in April 2023. This effort strives for a future where technology is safe, secure and resilient by design by encouraging software manufacturers to take ownership of customer security outcomes. In October 2023, CISA and 17 U.S. and international partners published an update to a joint Secure by Design white paper on “\nShifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\n.” Originally released April 13, 2023, this paper urges software manufacturers to revamp their design and development programs to produce only secure by design products. It also emphasizes three core principles: 1.) Take ownership of customer security outcomes, 2.) Embrace radical transparency and accountability, and 3.) Lead from the top.\nLeading on Artificial Intelligence.\nCISA published its first\nRoadmap for Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) in November 2023, adding to the significant U.S. Department of Homeland Security and broader whole-of-government effort to ensure the secure development and implementation of AI capabilities. This Roadmap outlines a whole-of-agency plan to assess possible cyber-related risks to the use of AI, provide guidance to the critical infrastructure sectors that Americans rely on every hour of every day, and capitalize on AI’s potential to improve U.S. cyber defenses.\nReducing the Risk of Ransomware.\nIn March 2023, CISA launched the\nPre-Ransomware Notification Initiative\n, which measurably reduces risk by warning organizations of early-stage ransomware activity. Since the Initiative’s launch, the agency conducted more than 1,000 pre-ransomware notifications across a variety of critical infrastructure sectors and to partners abroad.\nEncouraging Cyber Hygiene.\nIn September 2023, CISA launched its\nprogram. Secure Our World is a new and enduring cybersecurity awareness program that emphasizes four simple cyber hygiene steps everyone should implement and continuously improve upon: 1.) Use Strong Passwords and a Password Manager, 2.) Turn On Multifactor Authentication, 3.) Recognize and Report Phishing, and 4.) Update Software. The campaign featured CISA’s first-ever\npublic service announcement (PSA)\nand garnered significant public attention though outreach efforts including television, radio and billboard ads, podcasts, media coverage, social media and beyond.\nSupporting Critical Infrastructure.\nCISA enhanced its engagement with “target rich, resource poor” organizations, including the Water and Wastewater Sector, K-12 Education Subsector, Healthcare and Public Health Sector and the Election Security Sector. In 2023, CISA completed more than 6,700 stakeholder engagements with government and private sector participants to share threat information and promote its cybersecurity services.\nEnhancing Emergency Communications.\nIn 2023, CISA accumulated new subscribers to\nCISA’s Priority Telecommunication Services\n(PTS) program which enables essential personnel to communicate when landline or wireless networks become degraded, congested or otherwise unavailable. The PTS program covers wireline communications under\nGovernment Emergency Telecommunications Service\n(GETS), wireless voice communications under\nWireless Priority Service\n(WPS), and priority repair and installation of critical voice and data circuits under\nTelecommunications Service Priority\n(TSP). In 2023, GETS added 51,023 new subscribers, thanks in large part to focused outreach during the second annual Emergency Communications Month in April. In addition, WPS users increased by 283,357 subscribers. TSP also added restoration priority to 18,307 new circuits that support national security emergency preparedness missions.\nProviding Resources to State and Local Governments.\nIn 2023, CISA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) jointly implemented the\nState and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program\n(SLCGP). The SLCGP is a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program specifically for state, local and territorial governments across the country.  In September 2023, CISA and FEMA announced the of Notice of Funding Opportunity for the\nTribal Cybersecurity Grant Program\n, allocating $18.2 million to bolster cybersecurity among federally-recognized tribes.\nStrengthening Regional Election Security Support.\nIn 2023, CISA established\ndedicated election security advisors (ESAs\n) in each of its 10 regions to provide support and resources to promote secure elections. These ESAs work directly for CISA’s Regional Directors and with the agency’s cybersecurity and protective security advisors to ensure CISA’s capabilities and services are being optimally employed to meet the unique needs of each state or locality.\nImproving Security for Chemical Facilities.\nCISA celebrated the second\nvoluntary program in November 2023. This program provides facilities possessing dangerous chemicals with tailored, scalable, no-cost services and tools to improve their chemical cyber and physical security posture.\nThis digitally interactive 2023 Year in Review takes on a new look and feel, providing the reader with a brief snapshot of CISA’s accomplishments while linking back to corresponding CISA.gov webpages for a deeper dive into its programs and initiatives.\nto learn more about CISA’s accomplishments and success stories from 2023.\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nCISA Announces Opening of Attaché Office in London, UK\nStatement from CISA Director Easterly on Potential Russian Cyberattacks Against the United States\nMitigating Threats Posed by Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors’ Exploitation of Default Multifactor Authentication Protocol and \"PrintNightmare\" Vulnerability\nCISA Launches Tribal Affairs Webpage",

The use of Chinese-manufactured UAS in critical infrastructure operations risks exposing sensitive information to PRC authorities. This guidance outlines the potential vulnerabilities to networks and sensitive information when operated without the proper cybersecurity protocols and the potential consequences that could result.\n“Our nation’s critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy, chemical and communications, are increasingly relying on UAS for various missions that ultimately reduce operating costs and improve staff safety. However, the use of Chinese-manufactured UAS risks exposing sensitive information that jeopardizes U.S. national security, economic security, and public health and safety,” said\nExecutive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security, Dr. David Mussington\n. “With our FBI partners, CISA continues to call urgent attention to China’s aggressive cyber operations to steal intellectual property and sensitive data from organizations. We encourage any organization procuring and operating UAS to review the guidance and take action to mitigate risk. We must work together to ensure the security and resilience of our critical infrastructure.”\n“Without mitigations in place, the widespread deployment of Chinese-manufactured UAS in our nation’s key sectors is a national security concern, and it carries the risk of unauthorized access to systems and data,” said\nAssistant Director of the FBI’s Cyber Division, Bryan A. Vorndran\n. “The FBI and our CISA partners have issued UAS guidance in order to help safeguard our critical infrastructure and reduce the risk for all of us.”\nCritical infrastructure organizations are encouraged to operate UAS that are secure-by-design and manufactured by U.S. companies.

How do companies measure the dollar cost of defects in their SDLC?\nSecurity is often relegated to be an elective in education:\nWhat are some examples of higher education incorporating foundational security knowledge into their computer science curricula; When new graduates look for jobs, do companies evaluate security skills, knowledge, and experience during the hiring stage, or are employees reskilled after being hired?\nRecurring vulnerabilities\n: What are barriers to eliminating recurring classes of vulnerability; how can we lead more companies to identify and invest in eliminating recurring vulnerabilities; how could the common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) and common weakness enumeration (CWE) programs help?\nOperational technology (OT)\n: What incentives would likely lead customers to increase their demand for security features; Which OT products or companies have implemented some of the core tenants of secure by design engineering?\nEconomics of secure by design:\nWhat are the costs to implement secure by design and default principles and tactics, and how do these compare to costs responding to incidents and breaches?\n“While we have already received a wide range of feedback on our secure by design campaign, we need to incorporate the broadest possible range of perspectives,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. Our goal to drive toward a future where technology is safe and secure by design requires action by every technology manufacturer and clear demand by every customer, which in turn requires us to rigorously seek and incorporate input. The President’s National Cybersecurity Strategy calls for a fundamental shift in responsibility for security from the customer to software manufacturers, and input from this RFI will help us define our path ahead, including updates to our joint seal Secure by Design whitepaper.\nCo-sealed by 18 U.S. and international agencies, our recent Secure by Design guidance strongly encourages every software manufacturer to build products in a way that reduces the burden of cybersecurity on customers. More recently, CISA launched a new series of Secure by Design Alerts outlining the real-world harms that result from technology products that are not secure by design.\nWith our partners, CISA encourages technology manufacturers and all interested stakeholders to review the Request for Information and provide written comment on or before 20 February 2024. Instructions for submitting comment are available in the\nRequest for Information\n. The feedback on our current analysis or approaches will help inform future iterations of the whitepaper and our collaborative work with the global community.\n, visit our webpage. Questions regarding the RFI can be emailed to\nSecureByDesign@cisa.dhs.gov\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, CISA leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

Why is it so important? Well, it’s such a simple concept, but it provides great value to all of those involved in vulnerability management and disclosure.When security researchers and bug hunters uncover vulnerabilities in an organization’s ecosystem, how do they even know who to reach out to? Without clear reporting channels, researchers may be unable to quickly discern where to report vulnerabilities – meanwhile the organization remains vulnerable to attackers. However, there is an opportunity for all organizations to overcome this obstacle in line with CISA’s guidance through a simple text file - the security.txt file.Earlier this year, CISA launched the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) program, which proactively discovers and notifies organizations of their exposure to internet-accessible vulnerabilities used in ransomware attacks. This is a proactive program used to enable organizations to take early mitigation measures before an incident occurs. Our current notification process can be hampered by the inability to find appropriate point of contact information for organizations. According to a recent study, only about a half of a percent of the world’s top one million websites publish a security.txt file. The lack of this simple file leads to multiple emails and phone calls to the organization, delaying the notification process and the organization’s awareness of the critical need to mitigate their risk to ransomware.In an effort to accelerate the delivery of all notifications, CISA supports using the “security.txt” standard to streamline notifications and reduce the risk of compromise. It not only helps our work but also supports other partners that try to warn organizations of internet-accessible vulnerabilities susceptible to cyber threat actors – this is most important for organizations aligned to our most valuable critical infrastructure sectors. For those that don’t already know, the security.txt is a proposed Internet standard, RFC 9116, which concisely advertises an entity’s vulnerability disclosure process. Like robots.txt, this machine-readable file resides on a public-facing webserver, either in the root or “well-known” directory, where security professionals and researchers can quickly identify the entity’s preferences for reporting vulnerabilities.

Nearly a decade ago, CISA stood up our Automated Indicator Sharing, or AIS, program to widely exchange machine-readable cyber threat information. We know that the only constant in cybersecurity is change, and we’re evolving our information sharing approaches to maximize value to our partners and keep pace with a changing threat environment.How Did We Get Here?Every day, CISA evaluates the cyber threat environment, considers the impact of known vulnerabilities, and assesses the defensive posture of entities across our Nation to determine how we can most effectively safeguard critical infrastructure and government networks. Our insight is derived from a variety of sources to include classified and open-source reporting; operational collaboration with government and industry partners; findings from CISA assessments and incident response; and from information shared by members of our broad cybersecurity community through  mechanisms such as AIS.CISA then translates these insights into timely and relevant information. We share information broadly on a global scale, through alerts, advisories, and our Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. We enrich our shared services and cyber capabilities with cyber threat information (CTI). And we leverage these insights to design and prioritize new cyber capabilities for programs such as Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM). Across the board, CISA incorporates our unique insights of the global cyber threat environment into everything we offer to provide value to our partners.While these threat-informed products and capabilities are important to many of our stakeholders, we know that organizations also benefit from receiving cyber threat information to shape investment decisions and prioritize mitigation actions. It is not enough to monitor broad cyber threats generally;  organizations must apply threat information to their own risk and technology environments. AIS was established to satisfy legislative requirements and to provide stakeholder communities with a cost-effective means by which to exchange cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with CISA and, in doing so, with thousands of cybersecurity practitioners across the country and with partners across the globe. When it was first established, AIS was a novel model that helped many organizations around the world. But now, it’s time for a change.Where Are We Going?As the cyber threat environment evolves, so must our capabilities to analyze and share cyber threat information. When AIS was first designed, the U.S. Government was focused on filling an identified gap in cyber threat intelligence for many organizations and ensuring strong privacy controls. In the early days of AIS, the priority was speed. A decade later, the cybersecurity industry has matured substantially; current products and services are addressing information requirements for most organizations and, in an era of information overload, practitioners still require speed but value context, precision, and tailored insights over volume and velocity alone.In 2024, CISA will begin a strategic effort to modernize our approach to enterprise cyber threat information sharing. This effort will drive three key areas of progress:Simplification: We will refocus and consolidate our customer-facing cyber threat intelligence offerings under a new initiative called Threat Intelligence Enterprise Services (TIES). The TIES Exchange Platform will unify our information sharing capabilities under a single banner for federal agencies and certain user communities, enabling streamlined provision of cyber threat information from our partners and commercial sources. This will offer a common view which will facilitate communications and enable threat-specific engagement. As we design and implement this central solution, CISA is working in parallel to modernize our AIS capability which, in the future, will further complement CISA-curated threat feeds made available by this shared service platform.Partner-Centered Design: Throughout this process, we will be driven by the requirements of our partners, including federal agencies, critical infrastructure organizations, and state, local, tribal, territorial governments, to ensure that we are adding value rather than duplicating capabilities. We will continuously seek feedback and ensure that the platform itself is built around human-centered design principles to enable ease-of-use even for under-resourced organizations.Learning from Experience: We will rigorously learn from known challenges with the legacy AIS system: we know that it must be easy to both share and receive, that shared information must have sufficient context to enable prioritized action; and that every participant must recognize meaningful value that is additive to existing cybersecurity capabilities. At the same time, we will build upon the successes of the AIS program, including a rigorous focus on privacy and confidentiality by design.What to Expect Next?Our goal is to facilitate collective, automated cyber defense through increased sharing and context, shaped by an acute understanding of the threat environment. While CISA implements this transition over the next two years, the AIS program will remain available, and we encourage users to continue leveraging this capability and actively share indicators back with CISA.Our shared visibility into cyber threats is our best defense. When an organization identifies threat activity and keeps it to itself, our adversaries win. When we rapidly share actionable information across a community of partners, we take back the advantage. And, when we turn actionable information into strategic investments to drive the most important mitigations, we achieve enduring change. In this new year, we encourage every organization to make a commitment- perhaps a New Year’s resolution- to cybersecurity information sharing, including incident information, indicators of compromise, or even feedback and insights that could benefit peers across the Nation. We look forward to sharing more details about TIES and our cyber threat exchange modernization initiatives throughout the year. ---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

      "content": "Enabling Threat-Informed Cybersecurity: Evolving CISA’s Approach to Cyber Threat Information Sharing\nBy Michael Duffy, Associate Director, CISA\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nOne of CISA’s most important and enduring roles is providing timely and actionable cybersecurity information to our partners across the country. Nearly a decade ago, CISA stood up our\nAutomated Indicator Sharing\n, or AIS, program to widely exchange machine-readable cyber threat information. We know that the only constant in cybersecurity is change, and we’re evolving our information sharing approaches to maximize value to our partners and keep pace with a changing threat environment.\nEvery day, CISA evaluates the cyber threat environment, considers the impact of known vulnerabilities, and assesses the defensive posture of entities across our Nation to determine how we can most effectively safeguard critical infrastructure and government networks. Our insight is derived from a variety of sources to include classified and open-source reporting; operational collaboration with government and industry partners; findings from CISA assessments and incident response; and from information shared by members of our broad cybersecurity community through  mechanisms such as AIS.\nCISA then translates these insights into timely and relevant information. We share information broadly on a global scale, through alerts, advisories, and our\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities\ncatalog. We enrich our shared services and cyber capabilities with cyber threat information (CTI).

The advisory also provides network defenders and software manufacturers recommendations for improving their organizations’ and customers’ cyber posture, which reduces the impact of follow-on activity after initial access.\nThe CISA assessments team identified several findings as potentially exploitable vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the tested environment. Tailored for HPH organizations of all sizes as well as for all critical infrastructure organizations, the advisory provides several recommended mitigations mapped to 16 specific cybersecurity weaknesses identified during the RVA. Also, the advisory provides three mitigation strategies that all organizations should implement: (1) Asset management and security, (2) Identity management and device security, and (3) Vulnerability, patch, and configuration management. Each strategy has specific focus areas with details and steps on how HPH entities can implement them to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.\n“Exposure of common vulnerabilities and insecure configurations can result in detrimental cyber activity for U.S. healthcare organizations, such as ransomware, data breaches, or denial-of-service. The intent of this advisory is to help organizations maintain the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of their critical healthcare and public health systems, functions, and data,” said\nCISA Deputy Director Nitin Natarajan\n. “Adversaries and criminals will continue to target organizations seen as target rich, cyber poor. To reduce the burden of cybersecurity on customers, manufacturers of HPH technology products should implement the recommended actions in the advisory that are aligned to our Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software white paper. Also, we strongly encourage healthcare entities and all organizations to review this advisory, implement the mitigations and enroll in our\nvulnerability scanning service\nwhich can further help reduce cyber risk.”\nThis advisory builds on the CISA and Health and Human Services Healthcare Cybersecurity Toolkit and CISA’s Mitigation Guide for HPH Sector that were recently released. The recommended mitigations for network defenders are mapped to the Cross-Sector\nCybersecurity Performance Goals\nThe recommended actions for software manufacturers are aligned to the recently updated,\nPrinciples and Approaches for Secure by Design Software\n, a joint guide co-sealed by 18 U.S. and international agencies. It urges software manufacturers to take urgent steps necessary to design, develop, and deliver products that are secure by design.\nFor more information and resources, HPH entities can visit CISA’s\nHealthcare and Public Health Cybersecurity Toolkit\nHealthcare and Public Health Sector\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.\nfor more information and follow us on\nReadout from CISA’s 2023 Fourth Quarter Cybersecurity Advisory Committee Meeting\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",

Recent threat activity from groups such as Storm-0558 have demonstrated the importance of hardening email and identity infrastructure, enabling key security capabilities such as logging, and enhancing the security of underlying cloud environments. The Administration’s Executive Order 14028 has accelerated cross-government efforts to advance cloud security practices, implement encryption and multifactor authentication, and enhance operational visibility and logging on federal government networks.  Earlier this year, CISA worked with a dozen federal agencies to apply the Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) secure configuration baselines for Microsoft 365 (M365) across agency enterprises. Using our ScubaGear assessment tool, agency practitioners implemented advanced protections and configured cloud environments to better safeguard sensitive information and secure government services against sophisticated threat actors. Though the Microsoft-specific baselines were developed collaboratively with the Federal Chief Information Officers Council to provide necessary security enhancements for most federal cloud business applications, we quickly identified that more was needed. Today, CISA takes another step forward by releasing the SCuBA project’s Google Workspace (GWS) secure configuration baselines along with our new assessment tool, ScubaGoggles. Developed in close collaboration with Google, these materials are specifically designed to assist federal agencies with securing GWS environments and leveraging native security capabilities to enhance an organization’s overall cyber posture. However, every organization, public and private, can benefit from the security recommendations and best practices outlined in the GWS Baselines and should consider whether their current baseline requires enhancements in light of the evolving cyber threat environment.CISA requests public comment on the GWS baselines and the ScubaGoggles tool to help ensure our products enable necessary security improvements to keep pace with evolving technologies while considering the challenging cyber threat environment. CISA’s GWS Baselines draw upon the success, lessons learned and expertise gained from the M365 Baselines project to apply a consistent and comprehensive approach to securing GWS cloud environments. Once finalized and fully implemented, the GWS baselines will reduce misconfigurations and enhance the protection of sensitive data, bolstering overall cybersecurity resilience. These baselines provide a collection of tailored security controls for nine core GWS services. They cover key GWS components, such as safeguarding collaboration on Google Meet, securing data stored in Gmail or protecting sensitive information in Google Drive and Docs.  The GWS series includes minimum viable secure configuration baselines for: Groups for Business Gmail Google Calendar  Google Chat Google Classroom Google Drive and Docs Google Meet Google Sites Google Common Controls  The publication of the GWS and M365 Baselines will further CISA’s mission to secure the federal IT enterprise while also serving as a resource for all organizations leveraging the two most widely-used business platforms. Users across the Federal Government and beyond rely on these cloud-based business applications daily to communicate and store sensitive information and conduct critical business functions which is precisely why these systems remain such prime targets for malicious actors. Our goal is to help organizations secure their work, keep confidential information private, and empower cybersecurity teams to harden these environments and gain operational visibility within these cloud-based business applications.  Along with seeking public comment from all interested stakeholders, CISA asks federal agencies to help validate and enhance the automated implementation of these SCuBA Baselines. Agencies interested in coordinating with CISA to help refine the baselines, implementation guidance, and the assessment tool should email CyberSharedServices@cisa.dhs.gov.  Please send all comments on the GWS baselines via email to CyberSharedServices@cisa.dhs.gov by January 12, 2024.

Along with normal questions about peer relationships, physical safety, health, and after-school care, came an added layer of digital safety. Obviously my 5-year-old doesn’t have a credit card or a 401K, but the K-12 sector has grown to be increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, including data breaches and ransomware. While we aren’t dealing with a child’s retirement plan, these attacks have led to compromises of students’ personal information, exposure of school security information, class disruptions, school closures, and loss of already-strained financial resources – all of which harm our children and families.  In recognition of the K-12 cybersecurity challenge, the White House’s Back to School Safely: Cybersecurity for K-12 Schools Summit in August brought together school administrators and educators and a coalition of industry and government partners that committed to strengthening K-12 cybersecurity. CISA and Department of Education jointly released the K-12 Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible and Resilient—highlighting the leadership imperative to treat education infrastructure as core to our nation’s security. The brief urges school vendors and suppliers to build their systems, used by thousands of school districts across the country, with robust security settings by default at no additional charge and align with Secure by Design principles. Prior to the summit, CISA held a workshop with the education technology vendors scheduled to attend the White House summit to discuss challenges for the K-12 community and present Secure by Design, a CISA initiative co-sealed by 17 U.S. and international partners.  In support of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, Secure by Design is a movement aiming to shift the responsibility of digital security from the most vulnerable and least equipped (cash-strapped school districts, for example) to the most capable (software manufacturers). When we hear about cyberattacks, we often hear about what the villains did right and what the victims did wrong, but we do not hear about the vendors who use materials and methods that result in software with well-known defects.  Malicious and nation-state cyber adversaries have demonstrated countless times that they can easily find software defects and use them to steal money and data and lock up critical systems. As software weaknesses and mitigation studies over the past decade have found, it’s not so much a technical issue as it is one of political will and economics. As David Rice notes in Geekonomics: The Real Costs of Insecure Software, until we address the economics of software insecurity, we will not fix the problem. What does this mean? In the political sense, it’s the set of decisions that a governing body, (i.e., federal government, state legislatures, and local school boards) makes that prioritize cybersecurity as an outcome. From an economic sense, it’s understanding the value decisions made by each market player to create interventions that meaningfully shift the decisions and behavior of those players to value digital security. In this case, we are seeking to move the responsibility upstream to the software vendors, so we must take an ecosystem approach that factors in the challenges and opportunities faced by all the players. The K-12 community is a unique ecosystem unto itself, and our workshop was aimed at identifying the challenges and opportunities specific to the community. Schools must address a dizzying array of social and academic issues on exceedingly tight budgets. Allocating funds for recommended cybersecurity protections, such as Single Sign-On and Multifactor Authentication (MFA), is necessarily weighed against other investments that provide for the needs of children and educators. In our workshop, we heard that credential-based attacks, for instance, are a huge issue for the sector. Yet, participants said enabling MFA, one of the best tools for preventing unauthorized access to systems, too often remains a challenge in K-12. Since technical support provided by school systems to end users is often limited—and not every school can count on reliable cell phone coverage—administrators and educators may be reluctant to deploy MFA to vulnerable users. Moreover, in the education context, one’s phone can be considered a distraction in the classroom or a luxury that not all can afford. So, our goal is to identify what technological and policy innovations the government, private sector, and civil society can develop and deploy to address these challenges.  Because thousands of school districts in this country (in which staff, teachers, students, and their families are all players) are responsible for their own digital security, we will always be at an asymmetric disadvantage. And whereas schools are run at the local level, the expertise and resources available to safeguard critical systems and sensitive data are in short supply. There is simply no way we can expect school districts, whose primary objective is to ensure the learning and safety of schoolchildren, to bear the cybersecurity burden alone.  What if we shifted more of the responsibility of digital security from schools onto a relatively small number of K-12 vendors? Security could scale to those thousands of school districts, and each party could capitalize on its respective comparative advantages. Studies have shown that cyber innovations that scale are the ones with the greatest impact.  Certainly, education technology software developers face key challenges too, but cybersecurity issues facing K-12 could be much more effectively and cheaply dealt with earlier in the supply chain, by focusing on a relatively smaller number of linchpin companies serving very large numbers of students and educators instead of school district by school district, school by school. K-12 vendors need to hear about the security demand from school customers and school procurement processes must include security practices as a critical factor in their decision-making.  In turn, vendor security teams need further investment in tooling, training personnel, user experience, and secure software methodologies, all of which stem from executive-level business decisions. A company-wide plan for following Secure by Design practices to bolster commitment to customer safety should be the ultimate outcome.

      "content": "Findings and Updates from CISA’s Ongoing Collaboration with Education Technology Vendors to Address K-12 Cybersecurity Challenges\nOrganizations and Cyber Safety\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nThis September, my first child entered kindergarten, which, of course, was fraught with both trepidation and excitement. Along with normal questions about peer relationships, physical safety, health, and after-school care, came an added layer of digital safety. Obviously my 5-year-old doesn’t have a credit card or a 401K,\nbut the K-12 sector has grown to be increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, including data breaches and ransomware\n. While we aren’t dealing with a child’s retirement plan, these attacks have led to compromises of students’ personal information, exposure of school security information, class disruptions, school closures, and loss of already-strained financial resources – all of which harm our children and families.\nIn recognition of the K-12 cybersecurity challenge, the White House’s\nBack to School Safely: Cybersecurity for K-12 Schools Summit\nin August brought together school administrators and educators and a coalition of industry and government partners that committed to strengthening K-12 cybersecurity. CISA and Department of Education jointly released the\nK-12 Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible and Resilient\n—highlighting the leadership imperative to treat\neducation infrastructure as core to our nation’s security\n. The brief urges school vendors and suppliers to build their systems, used by thousands of school districts across the country, with robust security settings by default at no additional charge and align with Secure by Design principles. Prior to the summit, CISA held a workshop with the education technology vendors scheduled to attend the White House summit to discuss challenges for the K-12 community and present Secure by Design, a CISA initiative co-sealed by\n17 U.S. and international partners\nIn support of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, Secure by Design is a movement aiming to shift the responsibility of digital security from the most vulnerable and least equipped (cash-strapped school districts, for example) to the most capable (software manufacturers). When we hear about cyberattacks, we often hear about what the villains did right and what the victims did wrong, but we do not hear about the vendors who use materials and methods that result in software with well-known defects.\nMalicious and nation-state cyber adversaries have demonstrated countless times that they can easily find software defects and use them to steal money and data and lock up critical systems. As software weaknesses and mitigation studies over the past decade have found,\nit’s not so much a technical issue as it is one of political will and economics\n. As David Rice notes in Geekonomics: The Real Costs of Insecure Software,\nuntil we address the economics of software insecurity, we will not fix the problem\nWhat does this mean? In the political sense, it’s the set of decisions that a governing body, (i.e., federal government, state legislatures, and local school boards) makes that prioritize cybersecurity as an outcome. From an economic sense, it’s understanding the value decisions made by each market player to create interventions that meaningfully shift the decisions and behavior of those players to value digital security. In this case,\nwe are seeking to move the responsibility upstream to the software vendors, so we must take an ecosystem approach that factors in the challenges and opportunities faced by all the players.\nThe K-12 community is a unique ecosystem unto itself, and our workshop was aimed at identifying the challenges and opportunities specific to the community. Schools must address a dizzying array of social and academic issues on exceedingly tight budgets. Allocating funds for recommended cybersecurity protections, such as Single Sign-On and Multifactor Authentication (MFA), is necessarily weighed against other investments that provide for the needs of children and educators.\nIn our workshop, we heard that credential-based attacks, for instance, are a huge issue for the sector. Yet, participants said enabling MFA, one of the best tools for preventing unauthorized access to systems, too often remains a challenge in K-12. Since technical support provided by school systems to end users is often limited—and not every school can count on reliable cell phone coverage—administrators and educators may be reluctant to deploy MFA to vulnerable users. Moreover, in the education context, one’s phone can be considered a distraction in the classroom or a luxury that not all can afford. So,\nour goal is to identify what technological and policy innovations the government, private sector, and civil society can develop and deploy to address these challenges\nBecause thousands of school districts in this country (in which staff, teachers, students, and their families are all players) are responsible for their own digital security, we will always be at an asymmetric disadvantage. And whereas schools are run at the local level, the expertise and resources available to safeguard critical systems and sensitive data are in short supply.\nThere is simply no way we can expect school districts, whose primary objective is to ensure the learning and safety of schoolchildren, to bear the cybersecurity burden alone.\nWhat if we shifted more of the responsibility of digital security from schools onto a relatively small number of K-12 vendors? Security could scale to those thousands of school districts, and each party could capitalize on its respective comparative advantages.\nhave shown that cyber innovations that scale are the ones with the greatest impact.\nCertainly, education technology software developers face key challenges too, but cybersecurity issues facing K-12 could be much more effectively and cheaply dealt with earlier in the supply chain, by focusing on a relatively smaller number of linchpin companies serving very large numbers of students and educators instead of school district by school district, school by school. K-12 vendors need to hear about the security demand from school customers and\nschool procurement processes must include security practices as a critical factor in their decision-making\nvendor security teams need further investment in tooling, training personnel, user experience, and secure software methodologies, all of which stem from executive-level business decisions.\nA company-wide plan for following Secure by Design practices to bolster commitment to customer safety should be the ultimate outcome. Given that most companies are in their initial stages of the journey, sharing success stories, best practices, and aggregate data can lead to the widespread adoption of Secure by Design principles and demonstrate the return on investment.\nCISA is proud to count eleven education technology vendors that have committed to Secure by Design, designing products with greater security built in, an increase of five since we started this voluntary initiative.

      "content": "CISA, NSA, FBI and International Cybersecurity Authorities Publish Guide on The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nGuide encourages software manufacturers to address memory safety vulnerabilities and implement secure by design principles\nWASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in partnership with the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and international cybersecurity authorities from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, published a joint guide,\nThe Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps: Why both C-Suite Executives and Technical Experts Need to Take Memory Safe Coding Seriously\n, as part of our collective Secure by Design campaign to address the critical issue of memory safety vulnerabilities in programming languages.\nMemory safety vulnerabilities are the most prevalent type of disclosed software vulnerability; they affect how memory can be accessed, written, allocated, or deallocated in unintended ways in programming languages. As the most prevalent vulnerability, software manufacturers are consistently releasing updates that their customers must continually patch. Previous attempts at solving the problem have made only partial gains, and currently, two-thirds of reported vulnerabilities in memory unsafe programming languages still relate to memory issues.\n“Research shows that roughly 2/3 of software vulnerabilities are due to a lack of ‘memory safe’ coding. Removing this routinely exploited security vulnerability can pay enormous dividends for our nation’s cybersecurity but will require concerted community effort and sustained investment at the executive level,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “It’s way past time for us to get serious about protecting all software customers and implement Secure by Design principles into baseline product development to eliminate these types of threats once and for all.”\nThe guide strongly encourages executives of software manufacturers to prioritize using memory safe programming languages, write and publish memory safe roadmaps and implement changes to eliminate this class of vulnerability and protect their customers. Software developers and support staff should develop the roadmap, which should detail how the manufacturer will modify their software development life cycle (SDLC) to dramatically reduce and eventually eliminate memory unsafe code in their products. This guidance also provides a clear outline of elements that a memory safe roadmap should include.\nBy creating a memory safe roadmap, manufacturers will signal to customers that they are embracing key Secure by Design principles of (1) taking ownership of their security outcomes, (2) adopting radical transparency, and (3) taking a top-down approach.\nWith our partners, CISA encourages stakeholders, partners, and software manufacturers to review the guide and implement recommended action.

      "author": "Sandy Radesky, Associate Director for Vulnerability Management, Donnalee Beach, Section Chief for Cybersecurity Performance Goals, Peter Colombo, Deputy Section Chief for Cybersecurity Performance Goals  \n\n\n Related topics: \n\nCybersecurity Best Practices \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2022, CISA released the Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to help organizations of all sizes and at all levels of cyber maturity become confident in their cybersecurity posture and reduce business risk.Earlier this summer, CISA outlined four CPGs that organizations could implement as first steps towards better cybersecurity. While we continue to urge every organization to incorporate these fundamental cybersecurity practices, we are encouraged to see and share a few positive trends we’ve identified since they were released.In line with our Cybersecurity Strategic Plan and our focus on measuring risk reduction, CISA is measuring national progress in adoption of CPGs and associated progress in addressing key risks.Recently, CISA identified positive trends on two CPGs across nearly 3,500 organizations enrolled in our Vulnerability Scanning service before April 1, 2022. The two CPGs are: Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (CPG Goal 1.E) and No Exploitable Services on the Internet (CPG Goal 2.W). Of note, these CPGs are particularly important in reducing the likelihood of damaging intrusions across for IT and OT networks.Reduction in the Average Number of KEVsPrior to the release of CISA CPGs, the reduction trend in the average number of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) was not consistent. Since the release of CISA CPGs, the organizations enrolled in CISA’s vulnerability scanning service consistently decreased the average number of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) on their networks – the reduction average was almost 20–percent.Figure 1: With publication of the CPGs, organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning continued to demonstrate reductions in KEVs on their networks.This decreasing trend shows the progress toward the recommended action of “patching or mitigatingThis decreasing trend shows the progress toward the recommended action of “patching or mitigating KEVs on internet-accessible assets” within this CPG.Progress in Removing Exploitable Internet ServicesFor organizations enrolled in our vulnerability scanning service, CISA looked for trends in public-facing assets with exploitable services on the internet before CPGs and after CPGs were published. CISA identified that the vast majority of exploitable services exhibited modest declines (1-percent or less) among enrolled organizations.Figure 2: Organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning demonstrated continued incremental progress in removing exploitable internet services since the CPGs were published.Specifically, slight reductions were observed in services such as remote desktop protocol (RDP) and remote procedure call (RPC), which are common attack vectors threat actors use for initial access, ransomware distribution, command and control, and data exfiltration.Impact of Using Vulnerability ScanningOrganizations enrolled in CISA’s vulnerability scanning continued to show progress with a reduction or maintained an average number of KEVs exposed per entity and gradual reductions in the percentage of entities exposing exploitable internet services.  CISA anticipates continued progress toward CPG implementation and risk reduction among organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning.Figure 3: Organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning since the Shields Up initiative started, publication of CPGs, and CPG update and start of Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP).From April 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, enrollment in CISA’s vulnerability scanning service increased nearly 69% - more than 5,900 participating organizations.On average, newly enrolled organizations decreased their vulnerability exposure by 20-percent within the first three months of vulnerability scanning.  Moving ForwardWhile these trends are progress in the right direction, CISA acknowledges that there is room for improvement - this is only the beginning. Moving forward, we plan to periodically update and expand our analysis of trends that will allow us to track progress and focus our collective efforts on areas that require attention.CISA also plans to introduce new services and capabilities to simplify CPG utilization and enhance our ability to track national and sector-specific progress.When an organization uses the CPGs, CISA and our partners can help them understand the specific things they need to do to effectively reduce the specific risks they have identified. Our regional cybersecurity advisors are a valuable resource that can help organizations with assessing their cybersecurity and implementing CPGs.What You Can DoSince the CPGs were released, we’ve taken steps to encourage adoption, from the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) and the Shields Up campaign to our CPG Assessments.  These are intended to achieve a simple goal: to encourage adoption of CPGs and reduce the prevalence and impact of cyber intrusions affecting American organizations.We are taking this journey together and we welcome your contribution. Organizations should consider enrolling (and staying enrolled) in our vulnerability scanning service and conducting a CPG Assessment, a module within our Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET). This assessment can be self-administered or carried out with a regional CISA Cybersecurity Advisor.If your organization possesses data relevant to CPG adoption, we invite you to let us know about it by reaching out to us at vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov.Editor’s note: This blog is not a product of the DHS Office of Homeland Security Statistics or the CISA Statistical Official.

      "content": "CISA Announces Secure by Design Alert Series: How Vendor Decisions Can Reduce Harm at a Global Scale\nBy: Eric Goldstein, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity and Bob Lord, Senior Technical Advisor\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nCISA leads the national effort to\nrisk to our cyber and physical infrastructure. We continuously publish\nalerts and advisories\nto help defenders prioritize their work based on the current threats and software vulnerabilities. We additionally provide defenders with ongoing help prioritizing their scarce resources; for example, our\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities\n(KEV) program identifies the\ncommon vulnerabilities and exposures\n(CVEs) that malicious actors are actively exploiting in the wild.\nthe nation’s risk, we need to do more than warn defenders about the most current attacks and software vulnerabilities. We need to look much further “left-of-boom” and into the software development practices in order to fix things before intrusions cause harm to the American people. We need to identify the recurring classes of defects that software manufacturers must address by performing a root cause analysis and then making systemic changes to eliminate those classes of vulnerability. We need to spot the ways in which customers routinely miss opportunities to deploy software products with the correct settings to reduce the likelihood of compromise. Such recurring patterns should lead to improvements in the product that make secure settings the default, not stronger advice to customers in “hardening guides”.\nMost importantly, we need to convey that insecure technology products are not an issue of academic concern: they are directly harming critical infrastructure, small businesses, local communities, and American families. Today CISA is launching a new series of products:\nSecure by Design Alerts\n. When we see a vulnerability or intrusion campaign that could have been reasonably avoided if the software manufacturer had aligned to secure by design principles, we’ll call it out. Our goal isn’t to cast blame on specific vendors; to the contrary, we know that vendors make software development and security choices as part of broader business decisions. Instead, our goal is to shine a light on real harm occurring due to these “anti-security” decisions. While the usual dialogue around an intrusion is about how victims could have done more to prevent or respond, alerts in this new series will invert this dialogue by focusing attention on how vendor decisions can reduce harm at a global scale.\nOur first publication in the\nSecure by Design Alert series\nfocuses on malicious cyber activity against web management interfaces. It brings attention to how customers would be better shielded from malicious cyber activity targeting these systems if manufacturers implemented security best practices and eliminated repeat classes of vulnerabilities in their products – and aligned their work to\nOne of the core principles we identified in our\nSecure by Design whitepaper\nis to “take ownership for customer security outcomes”. By identifying the common patterns in software design and configuration that frequently lead to customer organizations being compromised, we hope to put a spotlight on areas that need urgent attention. The journey to build products that are secure by design is not simple and will take time. We hope Secure by Design Alerts will help software manufacturers evaluate their software development lifecycles and how they relate to customer security outcomes.\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration",

And while security is without a doubt a priority for businesses of all sizes, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by all the information available. At CISA, we have been diligently developing a solution aimed at simplifying the way our partners and potential collaborators understand their cyber risk and prioritize their investments, ensuring they can quickly navigate this complexity with ease. Our focus has been on making the process of working with us more intuitive and user-friendly so that every organization can spend more time meeting business goals and less time sifting through cybersecurity resources. We believe this approach will be especially helpful for smaller to medium sized stakeholders with fewer resources, who need help prioritizing actions to help them to reduce the likelihood and impact of damaging intrusions.In early 2024, we look forward to launching a new way for organizations to understand their cyber risk and receive targeted, straightforward guidance built around our Cybersecurity Performance Goals. This new tool is called ReadySetCyber. While we’re not quite ready to unveil all the details just yet, we are excited to share a glimpse of what’s on the horizon.ReadySetCyber will simplify the process of incorporating cybersecurity into your organization’s business decisions, regardless of your level of expertise or the number of IT personnel you have on staff. Instead of making cybersecurity a daunting challenge, with the ever-present question of where to invest next, prioritization decisions become a guided, step-by-step process on a user-friendly interface accessible to organizations of all sizes. By providing tailored resources and insights in a streamlined format, ReadySetCyber will empower users to align scarce resources with the most impactful cybersecurity measures for their organization.Our approach to ReadySetCyber begins with baselining your organization’s current cybersecurity maturity, based on your input to a dynamic set of questions, then providing actionable strategies, tools, and resources to mitigate risks effectively, along with a direct connection to your regional CISA cybersecurity advisor. We plan to launch ReadySetCyber in a beta capacity, while iteratively implementing improvements over time, using your valuable feedback as our guide. The questions for ReadySetCyber will be submitted for public comment before the end of the year, setting it up for public use in early 2024. This approach will help ensure we are not providing a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather tailoring our application to suit your unique needs.ReadySetCyber is about leveling the playing field and enabling our wide variety of partners to make measurably effective risk reduction investments. Our aim is to simplify and streamline access to the right information, ensuring that every organization can make informed decisions to enhance their digital security. With ReadySetCyber, users will be able to provide feedback on their experience, enabling us in return to refine and enhance our application in a collaborative way.

      "content": "Unlocking Tomorrow’s Cybersecurity: A Sneak Peek into ReadySetCyber\nBy Sandy Radesky, Associate Director for Vulnerability Management\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nCyber Threats and Advisories\nIn the fast-paced world of cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats is essential. And while security is without a doubt a priority for businesses of all sizes, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by all the information available. At CISA, we have been diligently developing a solution aimed at simplifying the way our partners and potential collaborators understand their cyber risk and prioritize their investments, ensuring they can quickly navigate this complexity with ease. Our focus has been on making the process of working with us more intuitive and user-friendly so that every organization can spend more time meeting business goals and less time sifting through cybersecurity resources. We believe this approach will be especially helpful for smaller to medium sized stakeholders with fewer resources, who need help prioritizing actions to help them to reduce the likelihood and impact of damaging intrusions.\nIn early 2024, we look forward to launching a new way for organizations to understand their cyber risk and receive targeted, straightforward guidance built around our\nCybersecurity Performance Goals\n. This new tool is called ReadySetCyber. While we’re not quite ready to unveil all the details just yet, we are excited to share a glimpse of what’s on the horizon.\nReadySetCyber will simplify the process of incorporating cybersecurity into your organization’s business decisions, regardless of your level of expertise or the number of IT personnel you have on staff. Instead of making cybersecurity a daunting challenge, with the ever-present question of where to invest next, prioritization decisions become a guided, step-by-step process on a user-friendly interface accessible to organizations of all sizes. By providing tailored resources and insights in a streamlined format, ReadySetCyber will empower users to align scarce resources with the most impactful cybersecurity measures for their organization.\nOur approach to ReadySetCyber begins with baselining your organization’s current cybersecurity maturity, based on your input to a dynamic set of questions, then providing actionable strategies, tools, and resources to mitigate risks effectively, along with a direct connection to your regional CISA cybersecurity advisor. We plan to launch ReadySetCyber in a beta capacity, while iteratively implementing improvements over time, using your valuable feedback as our guide. The questions for ReadySetCyber will be submitted for public comment before the end of the year, setting it up for public use in early 2024. This approach will help ensure we are not providing a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather tailoring our application to suit your unique needs.\nReadySetCyber is about leveling the playing field and enabling our wide variety of partners to make measurably effective risk reduction investments. Our aim is to simplify and streamline access to the right information, ensuring that every organization can make informed decisions to enhance their digital security. With ReadySetCyber, users will be able to provide feedback on their experience, enabling us in return to refine and enhance our application in a collaborative way. We are committed to listening to input and allowing it to shape ReadySetCyber into a capability that genuinely meets the needs of those who use it.\nThe information we received from our\nrequest for information\nthat closed October 10 will greatly help us refine and establish this new capability. We are excited to bring you an application that not only offers a tailored bundle of actions and tools for your organization but a capability that will evolve based on your needs and feedback.

      "author": "CISA Associate Director for Chemical Security Kelly Murray\n\n\n Related topics: \n\nChemical Security,                                                                                 Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember is a big month for Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Chemical Security every year. It marks the anniversaries of CISA’s two cornerstone chemical security programs, as well as the anniversary of CISA as an organization, and it is also the nation’s Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. Under normal circumstances, the CISA Chemical Security team is hard at work every November celebrating the annual accomplishments of our teammates, developing strategic plans for the coming year, and setting new programmatic milestones to keep the American people safe and secure from the threat of chemical terrorism.But 2023 is not a normal November for CISA Chemical Security. This summer, Congress allowed the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program’s statutory authority to expire, leaving our nation without a regulatory chemical security program for the first time in 15 years. Rather than celebrating the program’s 16th anniversary Nov. 20, we are facing a more somber milestone: today marks four months since the expiration of the CFATS program.As we call on all Americans to Resolve to be Resilient, we are also testing our own resilience within the CISA Chemical Security family. CISA continues to urge Congress to reauthorize the CFATS program. CFATS provides essential resilience for the chemical industry by enabling chemical facility owners and operators to understand the risks associated with their chemical security holdings, develop site security plans and programs, conduct site inspections, coordinate with local law enforcement and first responders, and continue to reevaluate each facility’s security posture based on changes in its chemical holdings and threat nexus. We at CISA follow our own advice: we believe in putting the right security plans and countermeasures in place before an incident occurs to reduce the risk of incidents occurring and improving resilience during and after incidents to reduce the impact on our communities and our nation. You can learn more about these security and resilience principles through CISA’s Shields Ready campaign, which includes four key pillars:Identifying Critical AssetsThrough CFATS, CISA screened more than 40,000 chemical facilities, identified 3,200 of those sites as high-risk, and worked with those facilities to understand the risks posed by their chemical holdings and develop appropriate security plans. CISA was constantly monitoring the landscape of dangerous chemicals across the nation as individual facilities tiered in and out of the program based on increases or decreases in these chemical holdings. Without CFATS, our agency no longer has an accurate national profile of the locations of these dangerous chemicals. We estimate that over the past four months, a minimum of 200 new chemical facilities have already acquired dangerous chemicals that ought to be more carefully secured; other facilities could be stockpiling these chemicals in excess of their existing security precautions, increasing the risk of terrorist exploitation.Assessing RiskThe ability to screen personnel is an essential component of security when a chemical facility is deciding whether to grant an employee unescorted access to dangerous chemicals or critical assets. Under CFATS’s Personnel Surety Program, chemical facilities could submit names of personnel with or seeking access to dangerous chemicals and critical assets; CISA would then vet those names against the Terrorist Screening Database. As of July 2023, CISA was conducting terrorist vetting on an average of 9,000 names per month. Based on this rate of vetting, CISA estimates that in the past four months, facilities have had to make decisions on granting access to about 36,000 employees without their being vetted beforehand by CISA for terrorist ties. Prior to the lapse in authority, CFATS identified more than 10 individuals with possible ties to terrorism over the lifetime of the Personnel Surety Program. Given that rate of vetting, CISA likely would have identified an individual with or seeking access to dangerous chemicals as a known or suspected terrorist at some point over the past four months. We cannot sound the alarm loudly enough: every day this program is offline is too long.Security PlanningUnder CFATS, chemical facilities were required to develop site-specific security plans to mitigate the risks associated with possession of dangerous chemicals. Without CFATS, we cannot inspect high-risk sites or assist these facilities with security planning efforts unless they approach the agency voluntarily for an assessment via the ChemLock program. We were conducting an average of 160 site inspections every month under CFATS; of those, more than a third identified security gaps, which were then added to site security plans for remediation. We can safely estimate that hundreds of security gaps have gone unidentified since July, meaning that chemical facilities are operating with no knowledge of these gaps or guidance on how to address them.Continual ImprovementCISA Chemical Security and the high-risk facilities previously regulated by CFATS worked together to ensure continuous improvement and adapt to the changing threat environment. Through regular and recurring CFATS compliance inspections, we were able to provide lessons learned and best practices to address emerging threats and challenges and, based on the performance-based nature of the regulation, require facilities to amend security plans to account for these risks. This, in conjunction with updated guidance and resources, helped to ensure continuous growth in the chemical security community. Prior to the lapse in authority, this process was going to be further enhanced by a proposed rulemaking effort to enhance the physical and cybersecurity standards required of CFATS.For facilities, the steady continuity of the CFATS program meant that they could project their security budgets years in advance; this is why CISA has traditionally supported long-term program reauthorization. Reliable and reasonable regulation bolsters resilience by allowing industry to make wise choices and build security into their budgets. Suddenly allowing the program to expire with no alternative in place has already led to confusion and concern across the chemical industry, reducing the chemical sector’s resilience in the face of an ever-changing threat landscape. Looking AheadFor CISA Chemical Security, resilience means showing up to work, day after day, determined to keep dangerous chemicals out of the hands of terrorists by fighting for the reauthorization of CFATS and doing everything that we can on a voluntary basis in the meantime. Our staff have been unwavering in their dedication to the chemical security mission. While the CFATS program is lapsed, we continue to offer expertise to chemical facilities on a voluntary basis through the ChemLock program, which is available to any facility with dangerous chemicals regardless of whether they were previously tiered under CFATS. Inspectors nationwide continue to offer on-site assessments and assistance, which chemical facilities may request via the ChemLock Services Request Form on the ChemLock homepage. Let me be clear, however: while the voluntary ChemLock program complements the CFATS program, it is in no way a replacement for CFATS.   We know the threat of chemical terrorism did not go away simply because the CFATS program expired. We know the best practices to protect dangerous chemicals against terrorist exploitation still work, and we continue to strive to share that knowledge with the chemical industry via the ChemLock program on a voluntary basis. But as we ask the nation to reflect on its security posture and Resolve to #BeResilient, we must face the fact that the absence of the CFATS program is a national security gap too great to ignore. As we call on the American people to examine the resiliency plans for the critical infrastructure that supports our everyday lives, we at CISA also call on Congress to reauthorize CFATS as a pillar of security and resilience for the nation’s chemical sector. This is a resolution we cannot afford to break.To stay up to date about CISA’s chemical security programs, be sure to follow CISA on Twitter and LinkedIn, and follow the hashtags #CFATS and #ReauthorizeCFATS for the latest news about CFATS reauthorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 26, 2023\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nOpinion | Can we Afford the Risk?

The domestic and international unity in advancing secure by design principles and cultivating a resilient foundation for the safe development of AI systems worldwide could not come at a more important time in our shared technology revolution. This joint effort reaffirms our mission to protect critical infrastructure and reinforces the importance of international partnership in securing our digital future.”The guidelines are broken down into four key areas within the AI system development lifecycle: secure design, secure development, secure deployment, and secure operation and maintenance.  Each section highlights considerations and mitigations that will help reduce the cybersecurity risk to an organizational AI system development process.“We know that AI is developing at a phenomenal pace and there is a need for concerted international action, across governments and industry, to keep up,” said NCSC CEO Lindy Cameron. “These Guidelines mark a significant step in shaping a truly global, common understanding of the cyber risks and mitigation strategies around AI to ensure that security is not a postscript to development but a core requirement throughout. I’m proud that the NCSC is leading crucial efforts to raise the AI cyber security bar: a more secure global cyber space will help us all to safely and confidently realize this technology’s wonderful opportunities.”“I believe the UK is an international standard bearer on the safe use of AI,” said UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Michelle Donelan. “The NCSC’s publication of these new guidelines will put cyber security at the heart of AI development at every stage so protecting against risk is considered throughout.”These guidelines are the latest effort across the U.S.’s body of work supporting safe and secure AI technology development and deployment. In October, President Biden issued an Executive Order that directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions. Earlier this month, CISA released its Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, a whole-of-agency plan aligned with national strategy to address our efforts to promote the beneficial uses of AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, ensure AI systems are protected from cyber-based threats, and deter the malicious use of AI capabilities to threaten the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day.

I’m proud that the\nNCSC is leading crucial efforts to raise the AI cyber security bar\n: a more secure global cyber space will help us all to safely and confidently realize this technology’s wonderful opportunities.”\n“I believe the UK is an international standard bearer on the safe use of AI,” said\nUK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Michelle Donelan\n. “The NCSC’s publication of these new guidelines will put cyber security at the heart of AI development at every stage so protecting against risk is considered throughout.”\nThese guidelines are the latest effort across the U.S.’s body of work supporting safe and secure AI technology development and deployment. In October, President Biden issued an\nthat directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions.\nEarlier this month, CISA released its\nRoadmap for Artificial Intelligence\n, a whole-of-agency plan aligned with national strategy to address our efforts to promote the beneficial uses of AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, ensure AI systems are protected from cyber-based threats, and deter the malicious use of AI capabilities to threaten the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day.

This will help organizations to better understand where to invest resources and will allow the government to ensure our future investments are making the greatest impacts. To put it simply, we want to understand what “good” looks like.Our nation’s critical infrastructure faces serious cyber risks, often accompanied by significant financial losses in the wake of a cyber incident. The digital revolution has brought much good—connecting humans around the globe in ways we never could before— however, each new digital tool and platform represents another potential point of failure in an ever-expanding attack surface.  Take ransomware as an example. Ransomware incidents can severely impact business processes and leave organizations without the data they need to operate and deliver mission-critical services. The monetary value of ransom demands has increased, with some demands exceeding $1 million. Additionally, according to the FBI’s 2022 Internet Crime Report, there was a 60%  increase in ransomware attack complaints (from 1,493 in 2018 to 2,385 in 2022), with ransomware losses exceeding $34.3 million. This is a lower bound that does not include estimates of lost business, time, wages, files, or equipment, or any third-party remediation services. With respect to cyber incidents broadly, the FBI report showed a 49% increase in losses from $6.9 billion to $10.3 billion over the same period.To address this crisis, we need to understand how to effectively combat the threat. That’s where the CIDAWG comes in. When we re-launch the CIDAWG in December, the working group will partner with Stanford’s Empirical Security Research Group, a research lab in Stanford’s Computer Science Department, with the intent to correlate data with cybersecurity controls to understand their effectiveness. CISA will ask working group members to collaborate with Stanford to improve analysis of the aggregated, anonymized loss data and link it with controls effectiveness. This analysis will be a resource both for insurers to inform their risk analysis and for CISA to better understand whether efforts like the Cyber Performance Goals (CPGs) and the Secure by Design initiative are translating to reduced cyber risk exposure for organizations that adopt them.At its core, CIDAWG will be a key part of a larger effort by CISA and federal agency partners to combat ransomware. CISA has many tools to support this effort, including the Joint Ransomware Task Force, the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot, and the Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative.  The Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative receives tips from the cybersecurity research community, infrastructure providers, and cyber threat intelligence companies about potential early-stage ransomware activity that can lead to early notifications to head off potential attacks.In addition, CISA continues to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which directs CISA to issue regulations requiring covered entities to report to CISA covered cyber incidents within 72 hours after the covered entity reasonably believes that the covered cyber incident has occurred and report ransom payments within 24 hours after the payment has been made. It’s critically important that entities report cyber intrusions, including ransomware incidents, to CISA or the FBI as quickly as possible. Reporting incidents allows CISA to quickly share information that can protect other organizations, limiting the ability of malicious actors to use the same techniques to execute multiple intrusions.In short, achieving the goal of driving down cyber risk, as stated in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, requires coordinated action across the United States Government, the private sector, and American society. Everybody has a role to play in cybersecurity…and we need everybody to play their role. I look forward to relaunching CIDAWG and working with our partners in the coming months to help collectively drive down cyber risk, improve the threat landscape, and prevent future cyberattacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 10, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nCISA Through the Years: Policy and Impact \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 07, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nTarget Rich, Cyber Poor: Strengthening Our Nation’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 19, 2024\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nFrom Naturalization to Cyber Advocacy: CISA Region 3’s Chris Ramos Inspires New U.S. Citizens\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

When most Americans consider the cyber-physical impact of attacks on critical infrastructure, they may recall when a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline’s corporate network led to a disruption of fuel supplies to gas stations along the East Coast. More recently, advanced actors such as Volt Typhoon have demonstrated the intent and technical ability to disrupt our critical infrastructure. These types of cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt critical functions on which we all depend, and in the worst cases, lead to the loss of human life.In response to this evolving threat environment, CISA is excited to announce a pilot program designed to deliver cutting-edge cybersecurity shared services on a voluntary basis to critical infrastructure entities that are most in need of support. CISA has acted as a managed service provider to the federal civilian government for years and observed significant risk reduction along with the benefits of cost-savings and standardization. Leveraging a new authority provided by Congress, we are eager to extend our support and enterprise cybersecurity expertise with non-federal organizations that require additional assistance to effectively address cybersecurity risks.Scaling CISA-managed cybersecurity services for the segments of our critical infrastructure community that need it most is a cost-effective way to gain greater insight into our evolving threat environment, establish a common baseline of cyber protection, and, most importantly, reduce the frequency and impact of damaging cyber events.Last month, CISA began deploying our Protective Domain Name System (DNS) Resolver to pilot participants which, until now, had only been available to federal civilian agencies. It is a proven, cost-effective solution that uses U.S. government and commercial threat intelligence to prevent systems from connecting to known or suspected malicious domains. Since 2022, CISA’s Protective DNS service has successfully blocked nearly 700 million connection attempts from federal agencies to malicious domains across the globe and continues to reduce the risk of the most common cyber risks like ransomware, phishing and malicious redirects. In short, CISA is broadening the use of our highly scalable Protective DNS service to ensure \"Target Rich, Resource Poor” critical infrastructure entities have access to some of the same cybersecurity protections which have proven foundational to enterprise risk reduction across the federal government.Through this pilot program, we are identifying critical infrastructure entities interested in leveraging CISA-provided commercial shared services, stress-testing our service delivery mechanisms, and demonstrating our ability to acquire, deploy, and operate these cybersecurity services at-scale. In alignment with CISA’s ‘Target Rich, Resource Poor’ strategy, our teams are working with critical infrastructure entities in the healthcare, water, and K-12 education sectors in our first phase of deployment. This year, we plan to deliver services to up to 100 entities.As part of this Cybersecurity Shared Services Pilot program, CISA is hosting roundtables and information sessions with critical infrastructure partners in every region and across all sectors. We want to understand their unique needs and challenges, identify gaps in existing capabilities, assess interest in our shared services, and identify ways CISA can provide more scalable support through shared services or other means. The insights obtained through these discussions and as a result of the Protective DNS pilot will inform our effort to better serve our nation’s critical infrastructure organizations.As America’s Cyber Defense Agency, we believe the ability to provide cost-effective, highly scalable, and innovative solutions to critical infrastructure entities in need of assistance is vital to our national cyber mission. As the cyber threat environment continues to evolve and the potential impacts on everyday life become more real, the need for collective cyber defense  increases. CISA stands by to support these entities and is prepared to answer the call.We look forward to expanding the list of participating entities and available shared services throughout the next year.

The whitepaper urges technology manufacturers to adopt \"secure by design\" principles in their manufacturing processes and highlights several tactics to make products safer by design. Both before and since we posted that paper, numerous news outlets have reported on potential threats facing consumers and the technologies they rely on every day. One such threat, humorously dubbed \"juice-jacking,\" even received some lighthearted commentary on US talk shows. For those who missed it, the reports claimed that criminals were rigging free USB charging stations in US airports and other public spaces. Since USB cables can charge a phone as well as transmit data, the perpetrators allegedly exploited this capability to install malware on victims' phones. Reading these articles prompted us to consider how \"secure by design\" thinking could be applied to analyze the alleged problem. The reports didn’t cite evidence, but some key questions related to these alleged juice-jacking attacks could help determine if manufacturers need to do more to protect their customers: Manufacturer response: What do phone manufacturers have to say about the vulnerabilities linked to these alleged attacks? Did phone manufacturers commit to fixing the problem?  If so, by what date?  Hardware: Is a specific hardware manufacturer or version of device more vulnerable than others? Operating system: Does  the threat affect a particular mobile device operating system, e.g. Android phones, iPhones, or both?  Are fully updated phones affected, or just those with outdated software? Device settings: Are there settings or configurations that can prevent the attack? If so, how can users adjust these settings to enhance security? Will the manufacturer make the secure setting the default in future versions? Detection: Can users detect the start of an attack? For example, does the phone detect a potential problem and ask the user to approve a data transfer? If so, is the wording in the dialog clear enough for the user to take appropriate action? If not, will manufacturers create or improve confirmation alerts? Can users determine if an attack has been successful? Can they check their phones for signs of compromise from a juice-jacking attack? Malware: What does the alleged malware do once installed on a phone? Does it steal passwords, mine cryptocurrency, or delete photos? Does the malware bypass normal OS authentication requests, or are users merely clicking \"Accept\", thereby giving the malware access to important files and data? Have any malware reverse engineers examined the malware to figure out its origins and purpose? I have not seen answers to these questions nor have I seen any evidence that juice-jacking is even occurring.  Despite the reports, the FCC notes that it is not aware of any confirmed cases.  That’s not to say juice jacking is impossible. Any code can have security defects and unsafe defaults, and phones are built from millions of lines of code. There may be vulnerabilities that make juice-jacking possible. But there is a difference between attacks that are possible, those that are probable, and those for which we have evidence of active exploitation. We should be careful not to jump from “it’s possible” to “it’s happening”The security of consumer and enterprise products are not acts of fate. Security is the result of many conscious and continuous choices made by manufacturers starting even before products are designed. Customers and journalists can influence those choices in favor of better security in many ways, including by asking the kinds of questions above. In doing so, we shift the conversation away from what the attackers might be doing to their victims, to what the manufacturers are doing to keep customers safe. We should frame the debate in terms of empowerment (“Manufacturers have made these improvements”) rather than continue to imply our helplessness, (“Attackers are doing X”). Simply put, manufacturers must develop products that are secure by design rather than putting the burden of safety on customers. Finally, for folks in a position to give security advice, please orient your guidance around the principles and tactics in the secure by design whitepaper. Ask yourself, who is your intended audience?  Are you addressing the customer or the manufacturer? If you give advice to customers, please consider giving corresponding advice to the manufacturers so that they can fix the problem upstream and eliminate the need to warn customers in the first place. It’s more effective to advise a few manufacturers than it is to instruct millions of people to overcome the dangers of unsafe products. The road to a “secure by design” world will be challenging, but it is possible. One of the first steps on that journey is to accept the very idea that technology products can be made safe, and to ask manufacturers to make security a conscious and continuous choice as they build and maintain their products.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJul 15, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nSecuring Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 21, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnlocking Vulnrichment: Enriching CVE Data \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 16, 2025\n\nBlog\n\n\n\nUnited in Cyber Defense: A Model for Operational Collaboration\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nSpotlight\n\n\nResources & Tools\n\n\nNews & Events\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency\n \n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nX\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nCISA Central\n1-844-Say-CISA\ncontact@mail.cisa.dhs.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDHS Seal\n\nCISA.gov\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\n\n\n\n\nAbout CISA\n\n\nBudget and Performance\n\n\nDHS.gov\n\n\nFOIA Requests\n\n\nNo FEAR Act\n\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nThe White House\n\n\nUSA.gov\n\n\nWebsite Feedback",

Critical infrastructure is a shared resource as well as a shared responsibility – we all play a role in keeping it secure – but underserved and under-resourced communities often face the same threats to critical infrastructure security with fewer capabilities to address them.  This is a big problem. To have a truly resilient nation, we need all communities to be resilient. Beyond threats from bad actors, underserved communities are more likely to have outdated or crumbling infrastructure and to have to deal with infrastructure related health issues--like what happened to the water in Flint, Michigan—or be more vulnerable to cyberattacks. We’ve also seen the news how extreme weather has increased the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, and underserved communities are often affected disproportionately, reflecting a further need for resilient infrastructure that can withstand these changes.  Fortunately, new resources exist that can help. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law in November 2021, allocated hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade for roads, bridges, transportation safety, clean energy, and other major projects.  CISA partners with communities nationwide to help them understand their risks and take advantage of the many resources available at no charge through CISA. In addition to tons of resources, we offer regional support in the form of technical assistance and training. State and local governments as well as critical infrastructure operators can also use CISA’s Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework (IRPF) to better identify critical infrastructure, assess related risks and develop and implement resilience solutions. Further, we encourage you to determine whether your community qualifies for funding through the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, and to review the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals, which provide guidance to help prioritize security investments toward areas that will have the greatest impact on your cybersecurity. Even as we ask all communities to Resolve to be Resilient this November, we are continuing that focus on resilience through the “Shields Ready” campaign launched on November 7 and continuing year around.  Inevitably, our nation will continue to face new and evolving threats and disruptions, whether from natural hazards or other physical and cyber threats. But by doing the work up front to prepare for disruptions to our communities and critical infrastructure, whether at a personal, organizational or governmental level, we can all stay a step ahead. This means knowing the risks, preparing and exercising a plan with a deliberate focus on continuity, recovery, and minimization of downtime, and then continually learning and adapting. We understand that underserved communities face additional challenges than most other communities, both in dealing with more outdated infrastructure and in having fewer resources to address them.

      "content": "DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Releases Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence\nRoadmap Will Guide CISA’s Efforts to Manage the Risks and Harness the Opportunities Posed by Artificial Intelligence to Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nWASHINGTON – Today the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released its first\nRoadmap for Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n, adding to the significant DHS and broader whole-of-government effort to ensure the secure development and implementation of artificial intelligence capabilities. DHS plays a critical role in ensuring AI safety and security nationwide.\nLast month, President Biden issued an\nthat directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions. As part of that effort, CISA's roadmap outlines five strategic lines of effort for CISA that will drive concrete initiatives and outline CISA’s responsible approach to AI in cybersecurity.\n“DHS has a broad leadership role in advancing the responsible use of AI and this cybersecurity roadmap is one important element of our work,” said\nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas\n. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to building a secure and resilient digital ecosystem that promotes innovation and technological progress. In last month’s Executive Order, the President called on DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally and help ensure the safe, secure, and responsible use and development of AI. CISA’s roadmap lays out the steps that the agency will take as part of our Department’s broader efforts to both leverage AI and mitigate its risks to our critical infrastructure and cyber defenses.”\n“Artificial Intelligence holds immense promise in enhancing our nation’s cybersecurity, but as the most powerful technology of our lifetimes, it also presents enormous risks,” said\nCISA Director Jen Easterly.\n“Our Roadmap for AI, focused at the nexus of AI, cyber defense, and critical infrastructure, sets forth an agency-wide plan to promote the beneficial uses of AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities; ensure AI systems are protected from cyber-based threats; and deter the malicious use of AI capabilities to threaten the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day.”\nAs the nation’s cyber defense agency and the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA envisions a secure and resilient digital ecosystem for the nation that supports unparalleled innovation and significant enhancement of critical infrastructure services provided to the American public. CISA’s roadmap outlines five lines of effort:\nLine of Effort 1: Responsibly use AI to support our mission.\nCISA will use AI-enabled software tools to strengthen cyber defense and support its critical infrastructure mission. CISA’s adoption of AI will ensure responsible, ethical, and safe use—consistent with the Constitution and all applicable laws and policies, including those addressing federal procurement, privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.\nLine of Effort 2: Assess and Assure AI systems.\nCISA will assess and assist secure by design, AI-based software adoption across a diverse array of stakeholders, including federal civilian government agencies; private sector companies; and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments. Assurance will be established through the development of best practices and guidance for\nsecure and resilient AI development and implementation\n, including the development of recommendations for red-teaming of generative AI.\nLine of Effort 3: Protect critical infrastructure from malicious use of AI.\nCISA will assess and recommend mitigation of AI threats facing our nation’s critical infrastructure in partnership with other government agencies and industry partners that develop, test, and evaluate AI tools. As part of this effort, CISA will establish JCDC.AI to catalyze focused collaboration around threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations related to AI systems.\nLine of Effort 4: Collaborate and communicate on key AI efforts with the interagency, international partners, and the public.\nCISA will contribute to DHS-led and interagency efforts, including developing policy approaches for the U.S. government’s overall national strategy on cybersecurity and AI, and supporting a whole-of-DHS approach on AI-based-software policy issues. This also includes coordinating with international partners to advance global AI security best practices and principles.\nLine of Effort 5: Expand AI expertise in our workforce.\nCISA will continue to educate our workforce on AI software systems and techniques, and the agency will continue to actively recruit interns, fellows, and future employees with AI expertise. CISA will ensure that internal training reflects—and new recruits understand—the legal, ethical, and policy aspects of AI-based software systems in addition to the technical aspects.\nCISA’s mission sits at the intersection of strengthening cybersecurity and protecting critical infrastructure and therefore plays a key role in advancing the Administration’s goal of ensuring that AI is safe, secure, and resilient. CISA will assess possible cyber-related risks to the use of AI and provide guidance to the critical infrastructure sectors that Americans rely on every hour of every day.

      "content": "Opinion | Can we Afford the Risk? Measuring the cost of the Expiration of the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards Program\nCritical Infrastructure Security and Resilience\nIt has been nearly three months since the American people lost an essential program guarding against the threat of terrorist exploitation of dangerous chemicals. For more than 15 years, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program helped protect communities across the nation.\nThrough the CFATS program, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) identified facilities with dangerous chemicals to reduce the risk that those chemicals could be weaponized by terrorists and other bad actors. The CFATS program was developed as a direct response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, with the goal of preventing another attack of that scope. The over 300 chemicals monitored by the CFATS program, in the hands of those intent on harm, have the capability to release a toxic plume or create an explosion that in some cases could be as devastating as a nuclear blast.\nOn July 28, 2023, the CFATS authorization expired. The impact has been significant. CISA can no longer conduct CFATS inspections at high-risk sites, enforce the implementation of required physical and cyber security measures, or assess the risk to these facilities and the communities that surround them.\nOne of the most important provisions that came out of the CFATS legislation was the personnel surety vetting program. History has shown that hostile actors have attempted to use legitimate means to gain access to dangerous chemicals. To reduce this risk, CFATS mandated that anyone who might have direct access to a facility’s high-risk chemicals be vetted against the Terrorist Screening Database. CFATS ensured that CISA was vetting an average of 300 new names per day for persons with terrorist ties. As we approach the three-month mark for the program lapse, we have been unable to vet individuals gaining this level of access to dangerous chemicals. This means that since the end of July, we have not vetted over 25,000 individuals with access to dangerous chemicals who may be in position to use those chemicals in an attack on our communities.\nThe program’s effectiveness is not up for debate. The CFATS reauthorization bill proposed by the House passed on a bipartisan vote of 409-1 before stalling in the Senate. Industry leaders and Congress alike understand the benefits of the program, which has been reauthorized by broad bipartisan votes multiple times since its inception in 2007.\nOver the past 15 years, CFATS has improved security at high-risk chemical facilities by an average of nearly sixty percent. To meet CISA’s security standards, high-risk facilities have implemented tens of thousands of new security measures such as cameras, alarms, fences and locks, training programs, cybersecurity, and community outreach.\nHigh-risk chemical facilities are not evenly distributed across the country. Nor are they distributed uniformly across a state, or even within a single county. And far from what you might expect, they are not always isolated to the outskirts of well-populated areas. Of the over 3,200 facilities that CISA had determined to be at high risk of chemical terrorism, twenty-eight percent of them are located in the largest urban areas in the country. Over 7,000 schools, colleges, or universities stand within one mile of a high-risk facility. The same is true for over 300 hospitals. A terrorist incident at any one of these facilities could impact our most vulnerable citizens, along with their families, coworkers, and the surrounding community.\nOne of the CFATS program’s unsung virtues is the way that it has reduced risk exposure for our nation’s most underserved communities—communities that may be situated near a facility with dangerous chemicals yet lack the economic or political resources to advocate for adequate security measures.  What the CFATS program has done is provide a measure of equality that comes from having a single national set of standards, rather than the patchwork of standards that existed on a state-by-state, or even county-by-county basis before the program was implemented. Now, those protections are gone, leaving each community to advocate for its own security with whatever economic resources and political levers are available.\nCan we afford to return to the days before CFATS? Can we afford to ask communities to accept a higher degree of risk? Can we afford to give access to chemicals to those who want to cause our communities and our families harm? I don’t think we can afford to pay the price of inaction. The CFATS program is a rare example of a regime that is successful in implementing its regulations, directly strengthens our safety and security, and is supported by its regulated industry. When regulatory programs function properly, when they are non-controversial, it can be easy to underestimate the effects of their absence. We can’t afford to wait until an attack on a chemical facility shows us just how steep the price is of letting CFATS expire. I join my colleagues across CISA and the Department of Homeland Security in urging Congress to act swiftly to reauthorize this vital program.\nDr. David Mussington is the Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\nResilience in a Time of Uncertainty: National Chemical Security During the CFATS Lapse\nCelebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) Program\nForging National Resilience for an Era of Disruption\nCISA Through the Years: Policy and Impact",

We strongly encourage this community to review the paper and provide input that can help collectively strengthen and improve vulnerability management for all organizations.\"\nCISA and HSSEDI (Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute) experts identified three features that are important for a software identifier ecosystem:\nAn identifier scheme with properties common to the SBOM and vulnerability management use cases, such as software name and version.\nA global authority that establishes common rules, assigns responsibilities, and identifies and addresses issues for the identifier generators would likely improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the software identifier ecosystem.\nThe paper presents six potential paths along with benefits, challenges and community or authority structures that would be needed to develop and sustain the identifier format ecosystem. It also offers potential software identifier formats that appear to be the most promising as starting points. These options are provided to the community as starting points to refine the merits of various operational models.\nFor more information, visit\nFederal Register: Request for Comment on Software Identification Ecosystem Option Analysis\n.

      "content": "CISA, HHS Release Collaborative Cybersecurity Healthcare Toolkit\nCybersecurity Best Practices\nWASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) co-hosted a roundtable discussion on the cybersecurity challenges that the U.S. healthcare and public health (HPH) sector system faces, and how government and industry can work together to close the gaps in resources and cyber capabilities. Ahead of the roundtable, CISA and HHS released a cybersecurity tool kit that includes resources tailored for the healthcare and public health sector.\n“Adversaries see healthcare and public health organizations as high value yet relatively easy targets – or what we call target rich, cyber poor.  Given that healthcare organizations have a combination of personally identifiable information, financial information, health records, and countless medical devices, they are essentially a one-stop shop for an adversary. For example, just in 2023, CISA conducted\npre-ransomware notifications\nto over 65 U.S. healthcare organizations to stop ransomware encryption and warn entities of early-stage ransomware activity,” said\nDeputy Director Nitin Natarajan.\n“We continue to work diligently with our partners at HHS and in the healthcare sector to secure our health organizations not only in the United States, but across the globe through our collaboration tools.  We are also focused on efforts to\nby educating the people, companies, and agencies how they can better secure themselves with cybersecurity.”\n“We have seen a significant rise in the number and severity of cyber attacks against hospitals and health systems in the last few years. These attacks expose vulnerabilities in our healthcare system, degrade patient trust, and ultimately endanger patient safety. The more they happen, and the longer they last, the more expensive and dangerous they become,” said\nHHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm\n. “HHS is working closely with CISA and our industry partners to deliver the tools, resources, and guidance needed to help healthcare organizations, especially our under-resourced hospitals and health centers, mount a strong cyber defense and protect patient lives.”\nToday, as healthcare organizations increasingly rely on digital technologies to store patient and medical information, carry out medical procedures, and communicate with patients, they are exposed to greater risk.  However, hospitals, health centers, and clinics, especially those that are under-resourced, are coping with a wide range of challenges making it harder to invest the necessary resources into cybersecurity.\nOver the past year, CISA, HHS and Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) Cybersecurity Working Group have been working together to deliver tools, resources, training, and information that can help organizations within this sector. Together, CISA brings technical expertise as the nation’s cyber defense agency, HHS offers extensive expertise in healthcare and public health, and the HSCC Cybersecurity Working Group offers the practical expertise of industry experts working cybersecurity issues in HPH every day.\nA key part of this effort is a new Cybersecurity Toolkit for Healthcare and Public Health that was unveiled at today’s roundtable. This toolkit is easy to navigate online at\nwww.CISA.gov/healthcare\nand consolidates resources like:\nCyber Hygiene Services\n, which use vulnerability scanning to help secure against known vulnerabilities, reduces the risk of cyberattacks and encourages the adoption of best practices.\nHealth Industry Cybersecurity Practices\n, which was developed with industry, outlines effective cybersecurity practices healthcare organizations of all sizes can adopt to become more cyber resilient.\nHPH Sector Cybersecurity Framework Implementation Guide\nwhich helps organizations assess and improve their level of cyber resiliency and provide suggestions on how to link cybersecurity with their overall information security and privacy risk management activities.\nThrough these and other helpful resources on the webpage, as well as through on-the-ground outreach, CISA and HHS are providing tools, information, and resources to help this vitally important component of the nation’s critical infrastructure reduce their cyber risk and reduce the likelihood of successful cyber incursions.\nJoint Statement from CISA, FBI, DC3 and NSA on Potential Targeted Cyber Activity Against U.S. Critical Infrastructure by Iran\nCISA Welcomes Madhu Gottumukkala as the New Deputy Director\nCISA and Partners Issue Fast Flux Cybersecurity Advisory\nStatement on CISA's Red Team",
