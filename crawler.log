Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain Security 












It’s April and time to elevate our ongoing government and industry efforts to reduce risks and confront security challenges facing global information and communications technology (ICT) supply chains. Supply Chain Integrity Month provides an opportunity for government, industry, and other stakeholders to increase collaboration and the sharing of best practices, risk mitigation strategies, and innovative solutions to safeguard supply chains from threats such as cyberattacks, counterfeiting, and disruptions.  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is positioned to synchronize and emphasize interagency and private sector collaboration and amplify common goals.    ICT is critical to U.S. economic and national security, as it supports all U.S. critical infrastructure and encompasses a wide range of hardware, software, and services. That is why the security and resilience of ICT supply chains is important to the seamless operation and reliability of U.S. critical infrastructure.   This year, CISA is promoting resources, tools, and information along four themes that help partners and stakeholders increase ICT supply chain resilience. Those themes for each week of April include:        Week 1: Preparedness: Building an Effective Supply Chain Risk Management Program    As the use of ICT continues to accelerate and expand, so will the attack surface for adversaries seeking to steal, compromise, alter, or destroy sensitive information.   This week, CISA is reminding everyone to go back to basics and apply actionable cybersecurity and supply chain risk management steps to strengthen their ICT supply chains. The Supply Chain Risk Management Essentials Guide provides leaders and staff with a refresher on basic SCRM practices to improve their overall security resilience.     Week 2: Mitigation: Knowing and Mitigating Against Supply Chain Threats   Conducting supply chain risk management threat analysis and evaluation is a crucial process for identifying vulnerabilities that could disrupt operations, compromise security, or impact business continuity. It is important to continuously conduct SCRM threat analysis and evaluation to gain insights into potential weak points and enable the implementation of proactive risk mitigation strategies before issues arise.   This week, CISA is highlighting the importance of threat-based evaluation of ICT suppliers, products, and services. The Threat Scenarios Report provides procurement or source selection officials in government and industry with guidance on how to assess supply chain risks and develop practices/procedures to manage the potential impact of these threats.      Week 3: Trust: Evaluating the trustworthiness of Vendors and Suppliers   As ICT products and services evolve to provide increasing functionality, the supply chains that deliver them continue to grow more sophisticated and complex. It is essential to be proactive in vetting suppliers/vendors to ensure organizations can mitigate risks, protect sensitive date, and maintain continuity of essential goods and services.   This week, CISA is highlighting the importance of building trust with vendors and suppliers as a key aspect of managing supply chain risks.   The Vendor SCRM Template provides a set of questions regarding an ICT supplier/provider’s implementation and application of industry standards and best practices that can help guide supply chain risk planning in a standardized way. The ICT SCRM Task Force developed a report to provide organizations with a list of evaluation criteria and factors that can be used to inform an organization’s decision to build or rely on a qualified list for the acquisition of ICT products and services while managing supply chain risks.    Week 4: Transparency: Securing Hardware and Software Across the Supply Chain   Hardware and software security are a core component of ensuring supply chain resilience. In today’s highly digitalized and interconnected world, it is crucial that organizations protect their hardware and software supply chains from increasingly sophisticated and malicious attacks.   This week, CISA is highlighting the Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM) Framework for Supply Chain Risk Management establishes a consistent, repeatable method for vendors to communicate with purchasers of hardware components in their products, facilitating the evaluation and mitigation of risk in a supply chain. We are also highlighting the Software Acquisition Guide for Government Enterprise Consumers consolidates relevant cyber-supply chain risk management software assurance guidance and frameworks into a single document, covering software during design, development, and operational use.    With our industry and government partners, we have made great strides over the last few years in providing valuable resources that help critical infrastructure organizations enhance the security and resilience of the global ICT supply chain. We also provided guidance to ensure that supply chain risk management (SCRM) is an integrated component of the Agency’s cybersecurity efforts. Please let us know about your efforts to raise awareness of supply chain integrity. Drop us a note at ict_scrm_taskforce@cisa.dhs.gov.   For more information, please visit Information and Communications Technology Supply Chain Security.

Emergency Communications Help Americans Be "Resilient Together"Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) celebrates the fourth annual Emergency Communications Month to honor the nation’s emergency responders and emphasize the importance of emergency communications in building resilient critical infrastructure.  This year, we continue to focus on how the nation can be “Resilient Together,” highlighting the importance of secure, interoperable emergency communications. CISA encourages critical infrastructure organizations—including state, local, tribal, and territorial governments—to enroll in free priority telecommunications services like the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) and Wireless Priority Service (WPS), which enable essential personnel to communicate when networks are compromised by weather, cyber incidents, simple human error, or any other reason. We also encourage them to continue to communicate the importance of resiliency and emergency preparedness. CISA is committed to strategic partnerships across the nation and ensuring that all aspects of the emergency communications ecosystem are prioritized and protected during disruptive events or incidents. I am confident that through collaboration and creativity, American communities can collectively overcome any adversity or adversary. We are stronger, together.  To learn more about Emergency Communications Month and find available resources, visit CISA.gov/emergency-communications-month.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












In today’s fast-paced cybersecurity landscape, staying ahead of vulnerabilities is a daily race against time. Every day, dozens to hundreds of new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are published, many of which affect critical systems. But let’s face it, simply knowing a vulnerability exists is rarely enough to act. As cybersecurity practitioners, researchers, and defenders, we need context. We need clarity. And most importantly, we need actionable insights that can help prioritize patching efforts and mitigate risks. To that end, you may recall CISA’s May 10, 2024 announcement establishing Vulnrichment, our initiative to supercharge CVE data with context, scoring, and analysis that go beyond the basics. This post is a mid-year check-in to briefly cover the how’s and why’s of this effort, now that we’ve been running it for a few months.A Power-Up for CVE DataIf you’re an IT defender or a vulnerability management pro, CISA’s Vulnrichment project can make your life easier. It enriches basic CVE data with actionable insights like Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) decision points, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs, and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), all bundled into the CVE records you’re already pulling. Think of it as a turbocharged upgrade to the CVE data you’re already consuming. Best part? You don’t need to set up anything new—this enriched data is automatically baked into the CVE feeds you’re already using.You’re soaking in it!Today, all Vulnrichment data ends up in the Authorized Data Publisher (ADP) container for individual CVEs, so if you’re pulling CVE data from https://cve.org via the API, or from GitHub at https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5 ,  you’re already collecting Vulnrichment data. It’s just a matter of parsing it out. Here’s an example:This is for CVE-2023-45727, selected because it’s a recent KEV entry that has a full Vulnrichment ADP container. Let’s say you wanted to query the “Exploitation” field of the CISA-provided SSVC decision points. You’d iterate over the ADP container, look for the Vulnrichment ADP container, look for the SSVC decision point, and then return the value for “exploitation.” Using the command line tool jq as an example, that might look like this:jq -r '.containers.adp[] | select(.title == "CISA ADP Vulnrichment") | .metrics[]?.other? | select(.type == "ssvc") | .content.options[]? | select(.Exploitation) | .Exploitation' CVE-2023-45727.jsonactiveThis query will return one of “active,” “poc,” or “none.” Found a problem?Let’s say you’re happily parsing all this Vulnrichment data, but you found a mistake in one, like the wrong CWE assigned in the Vulnrichment container. Taking CVE-2023-45727 again as the example, let’s pretend that CISA accidentally assigned CWE-610, “Externally Controlled Reference to a Resource in Another Sphere,” when it really should be CWE-611, “Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference.” Instead of just gnashing your teeth and wondering how we could be so foolish, you are invited to open an issue at GitHub (specifically, at https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment/issues ) and tell us about it, like so:We take our inbound issues pretty seriously and aim to have them resolved quickly. These kinds of bug reports make Vulnrichment not only an authoritative source of truth about CVEs, but a responsive source, as well.The Value of VulnrichmentIf you’re consuming CVE data – and if you’ve read this far, chances are pretty good you are – you’re probably already using the regular CVE APIs. But, unless you’re parsing out the ADP container, you’re missing out on some key benefits. Here’s why:Clarity and Actionability: CVE data can be… a bit sparse. Simply knowing that a vulnerability exists doesn’t tell you whether it’s been exploited in the wild, if user interaction is required to exploit it, or what vectors are available to attackers. With Vulnrichment, CISA adds broad context in the form of SSVC decision points that help you understand the exploitability, impact, and automatability of a vulnerability. This additional layer of intelligence lets you prioritize remediation based on actual threat risk.Prioritization On Easy Mode: With Vulnrichment, vulnerabilities are enriched with actionable data points like Exploitability (Is there a public exploit? Is it actively being used in the wild?), Technical Impact (Is this vulnerability likely to grant full control over your system, or mere information disclosure?) and Automatability (Can attackers exploit this vulnerability at will, or does it require some setup every time?). This makes the question of “What should I patch first?” a whole lot easier to answer. These all come under the “SSVC” section of the ADP container, which you can learn more about at https://cisa.gov/ssvc, as well as a future blog post dedicated to CISA’s use and advocacy for SSVC!Confidence in Your Data: Vulnrichment ensures that the CVE data you’re working with is more accurate and complete. If the data provided by the original CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) didn’t provide some key data points, CISA fills in the gaps, adding CWE Identifiers and CVSS scores when it’s possible to determine those. If the CVE is later updated by the issuing CNA with more direct information, CISA’s contribution will be removed to avoid confusing conflicts. All of this is to say that when you’re looking at fresh CVE data, you know you’re always working with the best available intelligence about those vulnerabilities.Friends, Admins, and Countrymen: Lend me your eyes!“Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow,” quipped Eric S. Raymond in the seminal The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and we here at CISA believe we’ve built a pretty good eyeball-attractor with Vulnrichment.Of course, this is more than just an academic project. We’re not here to merely admire the problems inherent in sharing vulnerability information and prioritizing patching efforts. Vulnrichment is an ongoing, operational effort to make CVE data more useful, actionable, and accurate for everyone. By adding CISA’s unique operational context, scoring, and more detailed analysis to CVEs, CISA hopes to enrich the growing CVE corpus and create a dynamic, living resource that helps security professionals make smarter decisions faster. So, whether you’re a researcher, a security analyst, or an enterprise IT manager, take a look at what Vulnrichment has to offer, and if you’re so inclined, offer your opinions on how to make it even better. Ready to get started? Head over to the Vulnrichment GitHub repo and get ready to level up your vulnerability management game.

2025-07-25 22:10:19,304 - INFO - Đã crawl thành công: Defending Democracy: The #PROTECT2024 Chapter in Election Infrastructure Security - Tác giả: giving voice to its citizens, American democracy embodied our Nation’s independence, strength, and commitment to charting a new path, determined by the will of the American people. Over the past 238 years, this sacred electoral process has been tested time and again by foreign adversaries, wars, natural disasters, and disruptive technologies. And our democracy has not only prevailed, but, inspiringly, it has strengthened and evolved. As a Nation, we have embraced that all American citizens—regardless of race or gender—have the right to vote; and, we have adopted technology that enhances the accessibility, accuracy, efficiency, and security of the electoral process. This is our Nation’s unwavering commitment to form a more perfect Union. The foundation of this process is our state and local election officials, the public servants standing on the frontlines of democracy. They have been trusted to deliver free and fair elections since the dawn of the republic. And with each passing election cycle, the threat landscape has grown exponentially more complex. In the wake of Russian efforts to influence and interfere with our democratic process in 2016, Americans became much more aware that the thing that makes our country so great, our democracy, is also a prime target for adversaries seeking to undermine America on a global stage. It was through this lens, that we realized that asking state and local election officials to take on nation-states like Russia, China, Iran, and an entire ecosystem of cybercriminal gangs on their own gave our adversaries an advantage. This recognition led the federal government to designate election infrastructure as national critical infrastructure in 2017. This designation empowered and enabled the federal government to work with election officials and election vendors to strengthen the security and resilience of election infrastructure. Today, CISA serves as the lead for the federal government’s election infrastructure security efforts. We coordinate the efforts of the federal interagency and help election officials and vendors understand the threat environment, access critical resources, and defend against threats to election infrastructure. As we entered the 2024 election cycle, we faced the most challenging threat environment to date. Domestically, dozens of election offices received mail containing suspicious white powder, some laced with fentanyl, a potentially lethal drug. Election officials of both parties were swatted at their homes, putting themselves, their families and first responders in danger. In the lead up to November, there were multiple instances of ballot drop boxes being damaged or destroyed by incendiary devices; ransomware actors targeted election vendors and state and local election offices; and cybercriminals conducted distributed denial of service attacks targeting election related organizations and websites. We also observed the most aggressive use of foreign malign influence campaigns in an election cycle, largely led by Russia and Iran. While our foreign adversaries leveraged different tactics, they shared the same two goals: undermining the American people’s confidence in the security of the democratic process and sowing partisan division in American society. In the run up to Election Day we observed multiple Russian influence campaigns leveraging staged videos alleging attacks on the security and integrity of election infrastructure and processes in what some forecasted to be the most closely contested states. Despite these challenges, state and local election officials courageously met the moment and performed SUPERBLY. They delivered the most secure and resilient election in our Nation’s history. We at CISA were honored to help them secure our democratic process.  Throughout the 2024 election cycle, CISA worked with election officials of both parties in every state and territory across the country to provide more physical and cyber security services to more jurisdictions than ever before. Recognizing election officials have different needs and demanding schedules, we knew we needed to scale our efforts to ensure maximum access to our resources and tools. We introduced our #PROTECT2024 campaign—a suite of products, services, and trainings for the election security community to help them more easily and effectively prioritize the security and resilience of election infrastructure while simultaneously administering elections. Our #PROTECT2024 webpage served as a central hub for CISA’s election security threat information, product releases, and public notifications.In the field, CISA had already established a significant local presence across the country with existing staff like our cybersecurity advisors and physical security advisors, but we knew that election infrastructure had very specialized security requirements that required unique expertise and dedicated support. To meet this need, we built on our existing field presence, adding an election security advisor to each of our 10 regions. This incredible team of public servants and executive leaders brought over 210 years of election administration and election technology experience to the CISA team. Their leadership helped drive our expanded support across the country in unprecedented ways. Working side-by-side with election officials, we recognized that physical security at election offices was a real concern. To help meet this need, we cross-trained over 100 of our security inspectors to conduct physical security assessments on election infrastructure. This increase in capacity enabled us to deliver nearly 1,300 physical security assessments of election facilities during the 2024 election cycle—an unprecedented number for the Agency. This work helped ensure the physical safety of election officials and the physical security of Americans as they exercised their right to vote.  We also worked hard with election security stakeholders to move cybersecurity forward. For the 2024 election cycle, we conducted over 700 cyber assessments for election infrastructure stakeholders and provided weekly internet facing cyber vulnerability assessments to nearly 1,000 election stakeholders. While everyone worked tirelessly to enhance security measures, we also knew things were still going to happen, especially given the complexity of the threat environment, and incident response preparation would be crucial. We focused heavily on delivering trainings and exercises that addressed the full spectrum of threats and practiced realistic incident response. During the 2024 election cycle, CISA conducted 200 tabletop training exercises with the election security community. This included our seventh annual Tabletop the Vote exercise, co-hosted by CISA and the National Association of State Election Directors and National Association of Secretaries of State. This exercise included more than 1,250 participants from dozens of states and territories and a wide range of federal government partners. We also delivered over 500 trainings reaching tens of thousands of election officials and their state, local and federal partners.Perhaps most importantly, CISA, alongside our federal government partners, also took important steps to counter efforts by our foreign adversaries to undermine trust and confidence in the American democratic process. CISA developed publicly available security guidance for election officials that addressed tactics and techniques employed in foreign adversary influence operations. Many of these materials were developed in partnership with our FBI and intelligence community partners. We wanted election infrastructure stakeholders to be more aware and better postured to identify and respond when these incidents happened. Because we knew they were coming. And we were right. A major part of this effort were the five joint public notifications issued by CISA, FBI and ODNI identifying specific information campaigns by Russia and Iran focused on undermining the security and integrity of our election process. We did this to raise the awareness of the American public, the target of these influence operations, to help people understand what they were seeing and who was responsible. We pointed Americans to their state and local election officials, who lead the administration of elections, as the authoritative sources for accurate election security-related information. This election cycle again made clear that our democracy remains a target of our foreign adversaries. As a federal government, we are committed to defending election infrastructure against all threats, including those posed by foreign influence operations. The American people should not have to face these threats on their own and our foreign adversaries should never have the advantage.Election security is national security.We at CISA are proud to support the election heroes who serve on the frontlines of our democracy. As CISA’s Senior Executive overseeing our election security mission, I witnessed incredible collaboration across the security ecosystem during this past election cycle. Thousands of dedicated Americans showed patriotism with their unrelenting dedication to the mission. I am forever grateful to have worked alongside them. It is because of the tireless efforts of the election community, we can affirm that we do not have evidence of any malicious activity that had any material impact on the security or integrity of the 2024 general election outcome. Election officials ran the most secure and resilient election yet in our Nation’s history.  Their collective efforts to secure the 2024 elections proved, once again, that Americans can have unwavering confidence that the outcome of the election reflects without a doubt the will of the American people. And it is not because the process does not face threats, but because of the incredible actions taken across federal, state, and local government to counter those threats and ensure the security and integrity of American democracy.In a few days, CISA and other agencies will prepare for a peaceful transfer of power to a new administration. While the 2024 election is over, the election security mission is not. The threat landscape confronting our democracy will continue to evolve in ways we can’t even begin to imagine today. So just as our nation has done since its inception, we will adapt and fiercely protect our democratic process. Elections are political, election security is not.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












At CISA, collaboration is the foundation of our mission. In our interconnected world, securing our nation’s critical infrastructure requires the collective effort of government, private sector, and international partners. Operational collaboration is the engine driving these efforts. Done right, it brings together partners from diverse backgrounds to achieve what no single entity could accomplish alone. This broad network of expertise allows us to understand and share the best threat information, strategic guidance, and cybersecurity practices that address risks at scale. In addition to synchronizing the national response to major cyber incidents and campaigns, these partnerships also enable better prevention, resilience, and long-term defense. Ongoing Information Exchange and Outreach Our collaboration efforts are field tested almost every day. From the geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the early 2024 vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways, to the CrowdStrike global outage and ongoing campaign activity from malicious cyber actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China, collaboration across the public and private sectors has been a game changer for homeland defense. In each situation, we worked side-by-side with partners to share information and actionable guidance to help unify our collective defense against cyber threats. For instance, in advance of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, CISA launched the Shields Up campaign to help prepare our industry, State, and local partners for potential threats. We began a comprehensive outreach campaign that included dozens of classified and unclassified briefings, produced several joint advisories, alerts, and other information products. We exchanged critical technical information with key partners to ensure they were prepared to protect their systems from potential Russian state-sponsored cyber activity. Separately, when dealing with the Ivanti vulnerabilities, our collaboration resulted in the publication of novel threat information, which we released in a Cybersecurity Advisory that included input from several private sector partners.Beyond high-profile campaigns, our day-to-day collaboration produces tangible results. We work closely with experts to address systemic vulnerabilities, respond to ongoing threats across multiple platforms, and share indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures related to malicious activity and actors. This information sharing helps CISA and our partners proactively identify risks, coordinate responses, and develop mitigation strategies. Daily collaboration with our partners has also made it possible for us to stall or circumvent malicious activity, as seen during the ESXIArgs ransomware campaign when CISA released a recovery script for entities encrypted by the threat actor. Sharing Critical Cybersecurity Insights: Advisories, Alerts, and PublicationsWorking with our partners, CISA has led the global community into a new model for producing world-class cybersecurity guidance. Leaning on operational collaboration through the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), our joint products deliver timely, authoritative, and actionable information and resources for cyber defenders.  In 2024, CISA released over 1,300 products, including cyber defense alerts, advisories, and other content. Over 90% of our Cybersecurity Advisories were jointly sealed with our partners. Notably, through the JCDC we co-sealed products with a number of new CISA partners, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Estonia, Finland, and Sweden. With our NSA and FBI partners, we were also able to co-seal documents and further our already robust collaborative efforts with our cybersecurity counterparts in the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, and France, among others. These publications provide organizations with critical insights and actionable recommendations to bolster the defenses of critical infrastructure world-wide.Driving Cyber Resilience Through Prevention Our partnerships make it possible for us to enhance our collective cyber posture by focusing on preparedness and prevention efforts. Through CISA-led tabletop exercises and technical exchanges, as well as the development of cyber defense plans, we have been able to raise the collective cyber posture across sectors. We routinely lead technical exchanges with our partners to harmonize public and private responses to complex threats, like countering ransomware actors or thwarting advanced persistent threat campaigns. We also hosted six technical exchanges and led two tabletop exercises in 2024 alone with the open-source software (OSS) community. The tabletop exercise was created by CISA after the CISA OSS Security Summit in March and put to the test for a second time at the Apache Foundation’s Community Over Code conference in October.  Furthermore, since 2021, CISA completed the development of 12 cyber defense plans tailored to specific risks, including:Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) Security: Partnering with industry experts, we worked to create an RMM Cyber Defense Plan to enhance the security of RMM tools, which are widely used in IT infrastructure. These efforts focused on improving detection capabilities and securing the remote management tools that are critical to many organizations’ operations.Cyber Defense for Geopolitical Crises: In collaboration with federal agencies and industry partners, we developed cyber defense plans tailored to specific geopolitical risks, such as conflicts involving Israel and threats tied to China. These plans provide a framework for organizations to safeguard their operations during times of heightened international tension and work with government partners in unified response.Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security: More than 150 AI and cybersecurity experts from government, industry, and critical infrastructure participated in two tabletop exercises to simulate and address AI-security incidents, providing critical insights that shaped the playbook. Recognizing AI’s transformative potential and inherent risks, we launched an initiative culminating in the AI Cybersecurity Collaboration Playbook—a practical guide for public and private organizations facing AI-driven cyber incidents. OSS Security: Using the lessons learned from the aforementioned Open-Source technical exchanges and tabletop exercises, we developed an Open Source Software Security Roadmap to foster public-private collaboration to address OSS vulnerabilities and enhance the security of widely used software, guiding stakeholders toward best practices that protect both developers and end users.These joint initiatives are not isolated efforts but part of an ongoing strategy to ensure that cyber defenses evolve in tandem with the threat landscape. You can visit our Success Stories webpage to read more examples of how our collaboration with partners is leading to actionable insight and tangible results.Empowering Communities with Cybersecurity ResourcesCISA’s commitment to collaboration also extends to include regional engagement. Our field teams, which include cybersecurity, protective security, and election security advisors, are embedded across the nation, offering support and services directly to state and local organizations.In 2024, more than 2,300 organizations took part in our Cyber Hygiene program, which includes services like vulnerability scanning, cyber hygiene, assessments, and training programs. These programs help organizations, from small businesses to critical infrastructure operators, bolster their security measures and build resilience from the ground up. The strength of our partnerships is our greatest asset. None of our achievements would be possible without the dedication and trust of the organizations and individuals we work with. Together, we are building a more secure cyber ecosystem, ensuring the safety and resilience of the critical infrastructure that powers our daily lives.DISCLAIMERThe information in this blog post is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience,                                                                                 Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Resilience has defined our Nation since our founding. From weathering the Great Depression and mobilizing to support the Allied victory in World War II, to enhancing homeland security after 9/11 and the unprecedented response to COVID-19, the U.S. has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to adapt, to change, to endure moments of crisis, and to respond and recover. We must again embrace national resilience as we navigate a new era of disruptive change and risk posed by People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russian nation state actors, extreme weather, and technological revolutions. These dynamics threaten the reliable operation of critical infrastructure that businesses, our national security, and local communities rely upon every day. How fast, decisively, and collectively we adapt to and build resilience to these challenges will have an outsized impact on American prosperity for the remainder of the 21st Century. As the National Coordinator for Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, CISA has played a central role in forging resilience—from COVID-19 to incidents of domestic terrorism and targeted violence to unrelenting criminal cyberattacks against businesses across the nation to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Ukraine war in particular not only demonstrates how adversaries increasingly use “gray zone” and “hybrid” warfare to target critical infrastructure and sow chaos, but also how democratic nations and alliances can successfully be resilient against disruptive aggression. CISA’s ongoing operational collaboration with Ukraine and other partners on the front lines of these attacks, including technical exchanges focused on resilience, provide lessons learned and inspiration that strengthen our resolve to achieve the Agency’s vision of “Secure and Resilient Critical Infrastructure for the American People.” PRC cyber aggression most acutely demonstrates why we must embrace national resilience with more urgency. The stakes could not be higher, because the PRC and other actors no longer just spy and steal business, defense, and consumer data; they now deploy sophisticated campaigns to infiltrate, hijack, or destroy key critical infrastructures like ports, energy grids, water systems, and communications that would disrupt our ability – civilian and military – to respond to crises and simultaneously sow chaos throughout society. We all rely on these key systems, whether senior government officials, business executives, school and hospital administrators, or individuals and families. But in this era of disruptive change, the increasing interconnectedness of our cyber and physical systems means infrastructure systems that served as a highly reliable backbone for American power and prosperity suddenly feel like an Achilles heel. Disruptive cyber or physical incidents in one system or location, like the Colonial Pipeline or SolarWinds incidents, a major hurricane or geopolitical crisis, or the current PRC campaigns CISA is working to stop, can trigger cascading failures across multiple systems, infrastructure sectors, and regions, magnifying the impact and delaying recovery efforts. When there is no stopping Mother Nature and until we strengthen our defense against malicious cyber infiltrators, expecting disruption and building resilience is a national imperative at all levels of society. Resilience is not optional. In that context, CISA took a strategic approach through national calls-to-action in Stop Passing the Buck on Cybersecurity: Why Companies Must Build Safety Into Tech Products, The Power of Resilience: What America Can Learn from our Partners in Ukraine, and Artificial Intelligence’s Threat to Democracy: How to Safeguard U.S. Elections From AI-Powered Misinformation and Cyberattacks. The implication: critical infrastructure owner/operators, and society as a whole, must anticipate disruption from one or more of the threats in this era as the “new normal” and take preparatory action up front to enhance resilience, operate in a degraded state, and ultimately reduce or eliminate downtime when disruption occurs.  Resilience was elevated as an agency priority and, following the success of the Shields Up campaign, CISA launched the Shields Ready resilience awareness campaign alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to further empower the critical infrastructure community to prepare for, withstand, and recover from potential disruption. Shields Ready promotes four key steps to build resilience that will help individuals and organizations enhance their resilience postures, each aligned to free CISA guidance, tools, and technical assistance available to help achieve their goals. Over the last several years, CISA has doubled down on building resilience at all levels of critical infrastructure and society and will continue to launch and deliver customer-focused products and services that empower critical infrastructure and national resilience in the era of disruption. Other highlights of CISA’s resilience-building efforts since 2021 include:   Resilience-building Guidance, Tools, and AssistanceLaunched our flagship portfolio of resilience resources, centered on the Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework (IRPF) and including the supplemental IRPF Launchpoint and IRPF Playbook guides, as well as the Infrastructure Dependency Primer (IDP), an interactive tool to understand critical infrastructure, dependencies.Released Planning Considerations for Cyber Incidents: Guidance for Emergency Managers, co-developed with FEMA, a first-of-its-kind resource to prepare emergency managers for the disruptive, wide-scale cyber incidents common today.Increased the delivery of free resilience-building assessments by 80% since Shields Ready was launched to help stakeholders understand and mitigate their vulnerabilities.Co-led unprecedented DHS industry engagement on the resilience of critical underseas cables, resulting in the release of Priorities for DHS Engagement on Subsea Cable Security & Resilience.Community-Level Safety and ResilienceLed the DHS efforts to strengthen operational resilience of K-12 schools and school systems against disruptive cyber, physical, and anonymized threats. Launched the Be Air Aware™ program to increase awareness of cyber and physical risks posed by increasingly common unmanned aircraft systems (UAS or drones).  Launched the Operation Flashpoint national awareness campaign with the FBI to help businesses safeguard relevant products that could be used to make homemade bombs.  PartnershipsExpanded civil-military collaboration with the Department of Defense to build resilience in critical infrastructure that enables defense missions.Strengthened resilience-building partnerships with FEMA and the emergency management community, including significant contributions to the first National Resilience Guidance and updated National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) that further integrate critical infrastructure with national preparedness activities. Led the “Critical Five” allied critical infrastructure-focused partnership in 2024 with Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand and implementation of the “Strengthening Integrated Resilience” annual workplan that resulted in the first shared framework for resilience.CISA is committed to expanding and building on this important work, but we can’t do it alone. Business and government entities that own or operate critical infrastructure have a responsibility to enhance resilience because, no matter the line of work or location, critical infrastructure connects us all. In this era of infrastructure disruption, it’s imperative that all critical infrastructure entities work to build resilience by anticipating the potential causes of disruption, understanding vulnerabilities and interdependencies, adopting good cyber hygiene and replacing risky technologies, and developing and exercising incident response plans to sustain operations. It takes adaptation and discipline, but the reward is reduced risk of disruptive downtime and contributing to national resilience, overall. CISA can help.

2025-07-25 22:10:29,343 - INFO - Đã crawl thành công: Strengthening America’s Resilience Against the PRC Cyber Threats - Tác giả: prepositioning cyber threats within critical infrastructure networks, Volt Typhoon was poised to launch destructive cyberattacks of immense proportions against the U.S. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that the malign group compromised critical infrastructure organizations in communications, energy, transportation systems, and water and wastewater systems. In a moment of crisis, the PRC could devastate American communities. Through the vigilance, dedication, and hard work of the Threat Hunting team, Volt Typhoon was detected and evicted from many of these critical infrastructure organizations. Despite Volt Typhoon operating in a pattern of behavior inconsistent with traditional cyber espionage, they were no match for our best and brightest. Using their expertise, this unique group of specialists shared Volt Typhoon’s tactics, techniques, and activity with the public, ensuring that the malign group could no longer operate in the dark. Americans owe much to these patriots, though their work often goes unnoticed. This team deserves our deepest gratitude. On behalf of the American people and the United States Congress, I thank the Threat Hunting team for their service to this country.” Notably, a critical element in the U.S. Government’s ability to understand the totality of the Salt Typhoon campaign targeting U.S. telecommunications infrastructure was the fact that CISA threat hunters previously detected the same actors in U.S. government networks. This information, along with industry tippers, is what allowed our law enforcement partners to gain access to images of actor-leased virtual private servers. This, in turn, gave us and our federal government partners visibility into the breadth of the campaign and allowed us to notify and provide technical assistance known or suspected private sector victims.Despite the truly excellent work of our CISA teams and of our federal and industry partners, we know our adversaries remain relentlessly focused on holding our critical infrastructure at risk. And even as we’ve successfully eradicated numerous Chinese intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors, we know that what we have found is likely just the tip of the iceberg. This unrelenting PRC campaign underscores the urgent need for robust cyber defense and vigilance across public and private sectors. CISA’s approach to countering these threats is rooted in partnership and resilience. We remain dedicated to working proactively to reduce further risks from the vulnerable devices that the PRC is using to conduct their intrusions. In doing so, we are leading three lines of effort to address these threats and reduce risks to the American people: First, we are helping victims identify and evict PRC cyber actors from their networks. CISA hunt and incident response teams have deployed to find and eradicate the PRC’s malicious activity across multiple sectors, including energy, transportation, water, and telecommunications. Our regional teams—hundreds of security experts stationed in every state across our nation—are actively working with systemically important entities across sectors that we know have been targeted by PRC activity, helping them strengthen their defenses and reduce their vulnerability.Second, through our Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), we have initiated a cyber defense planning effort with key information technology, communication, and cybersecurity industry partners – as well as USG and international partners – focused on the protection and defense of U.S. critical infrastructure networks from PRC malicious cyber activity. This effort is focused on combining the collective visibility of the internet ecosystem to further understand PRC targeting of critical infrastructure and identifying and implementing mitigations at both the ecosystem and enterprise network levels. Third, we are delivering services across critical infrastructure that directly reduce risks posed by PRC cyber actors, including our CyberSentry threat detection capability; our Attack Surface Management services, now deployed across nearly 7,000 critical infrastructure organizations to identify and mitigate the technology defects that allow these threats to get a foothold in American businesses; and our best-in-class protection capabilities to help prevent successful intrusions against under-resourced businesses. The reality is, however, that rooting out malicious PRC activity and bolstering the security of critical infrastructure organizations are necessary but insufficient. While the PRC is a sophisticated, well-resourced, and formidable cyber adversary, the methods they’re using to exploit our critical infrastructure are not. They don’t have to be—Why? Because in many cases, we’ve made it easy for them. Indeed, the PRC is largely taking advantage of known product defects. The truth is that the technology base upon which our critical infrastructure depends is inherently insecure, because of decades of misaligned incentives that prioritized features and speed to market over security. That must stop. Technology companies must help ensure the PRC and other adversary threat actors cannot exploit defects in technology products to target our critical infrastructure. These weaknesses—and the resulting risks to our national security—can only be addressed at scale by companies building and selling products that are secure by design. We are at a critical juncture for our national security. The clear and present danger from China’s cyber actors must serve as a call to action for the technology and cybersecurity industry, the critical infrastructure community, and all of our partners. Specifically:Every victim of a cyber incident should report it to CISA, every time, recognizing that a threat to one is a threat to many, because cybersecurity is national security. Every critical infrastructure business should establish a relationship with their local CISA team and enroll in our free services, particularly our Vulnerability Scanning program, to help identify and reduce vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited by PRC actors.Every critical infrastructure organization should double down on their commitment to resilience. CEOs, Boards, and every business leader must recognize that they own cyber risk as a business risk and a matter of good governance. They must expect disruption, continually testing the continuity of critical systems and functions to ensure they can operate through disruption and recover rapidly from an attack. Finally, every technology manufacturer and software producer should design, build, test, and deploy their products using the practices outlined in our joint Secure by Design guidance. We must drive toward a future where technology products are safe by design and defective products are not present in critical infrastructure systems. The threats posed by the PRC are real and persistent, and we anticipate they will continue evolving through 2025 and beyond. But these threats are not insurmountable. By fostering a culture of security and resilience and developing IT and software products that are built with security in mind, we can protect our nation’s critical infrastructure. While such deterrence by denial must be accompanied by equally aggressive efforts to hold our adversary’s critical infrastructure at risk—deterrence by punishment—both are equally important to the security and resilience of the critical services Americans depend on every day. At CISA, we know that true success depends on sustained collective action and that the stakes have never been higher. We remain committed—for as long as it takes—to working alongside our partners to address these challenges with the sustained attention and action that they demand. Together, we can outpace our adversaries and achieve a more secure and resilient future

In May 2024, we launched CISA’s Secure by Design pledge, where now over 250 companies have committed to driving measurable progress towards seven key SbD goals. Since then, we’ve seen more and more companies report on the good progress they’re making. Expanding the number of companies signing the SbD pledge is key. Each new signer commits to prioritizing security at every stage of software development, creating a ripple effect that raises the standard across the industry.Equally important to the SbD movement is increasing the number of companies that serve as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authorities (CNAs). By identifying and assigning CVE IDs for vulnerabilities in their own products, CNAs drive transparency and accountability—much like car manufacturers adopting standards improve the safety of their vehicles. Together, a broader base of SbD pledge signers and CNAs will strengthen the ecosystem and make security become an integral part of every product, not an afterthought.The need for safer software isn’t new, just as the need for safer car designs wasn’t new in the 1960s. People knew for decades that cars needed seat belts, better brakes, and stronger frames, but pioneers like Ralph Nader linked car design to road fatalities and drove systemic change. Similarly, the cybersecurity community has long understood the need for secure software. What’s new is the SbD initiative, which unites public awareness with industry accountability to catalyze meaningful action.The Secure by Design pledge, the resulting progress pledge signers are making, and the bipartisan support for cybersecurity all signal that there is a groundswell of support mounting behind this movement. I believe we, as a nation, are ready to embrace it and move past the “before seat belts” era of software. I see a brighter future, where sustained effort and collaboration will make secure software the standard, not the exception. Just as car manufacturers eventually embedded seat belts, airbags, and anti-lock brakes into every vehicle design, I see Secure by Design becoming a core identity for software developers, with security integrated from the first line of code to deployment. Beyond developers and manufacturers, I see individuals and organizations across the entire ecosystem—open source communities, universities, insurers, Venture Capital firms, researchers, and regulators—playing their part to prioritize and incentivize security. Best of all, I see our nation embracing this movement to make secure, resilient software, creating a safer digital world for everyone.

Over the course of the last four years, CISA has played a critical and evolving role in the nation’s policy and strategy on cybersecurity, infrastructure security, and resilience. As a relatively new agency, these national policy activities have shaped and molded who we are as an agency, our role in the interagency, and our biggest priorities. As we begin to look forward to 2025 and beyond, we wanted to highlight some of the most influential policy efforts in recent years. 2021In the wake of the SolarWinds supply chain attack, Executive Order (EO) 14028, "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity" was issued in May, tasking CISA with a variety of actions to strengthen the security of federal government networks, including removing barriers to threat information sharing, modernizing and implementing stronger cybersecurity standards for the federal government, and improving software supply chain security. Later in the year, the administration issued the National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems, which directed CISA to develop a series of Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to meaningfully reduce risks to both critical infrastructure operations and the American people. These CPGs are a subset of cybersecurity practices, selected through a thorough process of industry, government, and expert consultation, aimed to help small- and medium-sized organizations kickstart their cybersecurity efforts by prioritizing investment in a limited number of essential actions with high-impact security outcomes.2022In March 2022, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) was signed into law, requiring covered critical infrastructure entities to report covered cyber incidents and ransom payments to CISA within 24 hours after a payment is made. These reports will allow CISA to rapidly deploy resources and render assistance to victims suffering attacks, analyze incoming reporting across sectors to spot trends, and quickly share that information with network defenders to warn other potential victims – better arming CISA to achieve its mission as the nation’s cyber defense agency. CIRCIA also established two additional efforts: the Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF) and the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) program. The JRTF serves as the central body for coordinating an ongoing nationwide campaign against ransomware attacks in addition to identifying and pursuing opportunities for international cooperation. co-chaired by CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the JRTF coordinates existing interagency ransomware efforts and works to identify new initiatives to effectively leverage the unique authorities and capabilities across the U.S. government and the private sector to address ransomware threats.Through the RVWP, CISA has identified vulnerabilities commonly associated with known ransomware exploitation and warned critical infrastructure entities whose networks or devices may be susceptible to those vulnerabilities, enabling mitigation before a ransomware incident occurs. The RVWP completed 1,754 notifications in 2023 to entities operating an internet-accessible vulnerable device. Following notification of the vulnerabilities, CISA regularly conducted vulnerability scans to determine whether the entities appear to have mitigated their vulnerable devices. Our findings indicated that 852 of the 1,754 notifications (49%) of vulnerable devices were either patched, implemented a compensating control, or taken offline after notification from CISA. 2023 The 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) laid out the national approach to increasing the ecosystem’s cybersecurity. It detailed a comprehensive list of actions for CISA to take alongside our federal partners and allies, including updating the National Cyber Incident Response Plan, countering ransomware efforts through the JRTF, and enhancing operational collaboration efforts with industry partners. These actions were outlined in more detail in the National Cyber Strategy Implementation Plan, which provided a roadmap for the implementation of the NCS. 2024Most recently, on April 30, 2024, the National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (NSM-22) further codified CISA’s statutory role as the National Coordinator for the Security and Resilience of U.S. Critical Infrastructure, empowering us to implement a new risk management cycle that prioritizes collaborating with partners to identify and mitigate sector, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk. This cycle, which will be refreshed biennially, enables systematic risk reduction efforts that the U.S. government will take in collaboration with relevant partners. The culmination of this cycle is the creation of the 2025 National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan, which will guide federal efforts to secure and protect critical infrastructure over the coming years. These efforts will be critical to help USG to better understand sector and cross sector risk and more efficiently prioritize risk reduction efforts going forward. CISA’s role has evolved and will continue to evolve to reflect the threat landscape and policy ecosystem that the United States operates in. We look forward to continued partnership with our federal, SLTT, and private sector partners to better secure our world.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












For decades, cyber risk was considered part of information technology (IT) risk and largely delegated to engineering and security teams within an organization. More recently, however, corporate leaders have begun to see cyber risk for what it is: a strategic, enterprise risk, which they—not their Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)—own. Today, given our complex, dynamic, and highly interconnected environment—an environment where nation state adversaries are more active and capable than ever, and where the private sector is on the front lines of the cyber fight—boards and company leadership must consider the critical role they play in national security and ensuring systemic resilience.To help advance this effort, CISA partnered with the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) and the Internet Security Alliance to develop the NACD Director's Handbook on Cyber-Risk Oversight, laying out a framework for considering cyber risk as a function of board governance. As noted in the Handbook’s foreword, we need a new model of sustainable cybersecurity—one that starts with a commitment at the board level to incentivize a culture in which managing cyber risk is treated as a fundamental matter of good governance. Indeed, Board members have unique power to drive such a culture through their actions and decisions:They should ensure that CISOs are fully empowered, with the influence and resources necessary to drive decisions where cybersecurity is effectively prioritized. Decisions to prioritize cost, features, or speed to market over security must be made transparently, with clear ownership by the Chief Executive Officer and Board and visibility by potentially impacted customers. Cybersecurity, as a matter of safety, should not be allowed to significantly lag behind innovation. They should ensure that their peers and the senior executives that they oversee are well-educated on cyber risk, that cybersecurity considerations are appropriately prioritized in every business, technology, and software acquisition decision, and that decisions to accept rather than mitigate cyber risks are scrutinized and revisited often. Relatedly, boards should carefully consider which committee oversees cyber risk: while cyber risk has traditionally been the purview of the audit committee and treated largely as a matter of compliance, a small number of boards are establishing cybersecurity or technology risk committees to more effectively manage cyber risk. They should review their company’s cyber-risk management framework and ensure the development of a common set of standards which the organization can use to determine and measure their exposure to cybersecurity risk. They should ensure that the thresholds for reporting potential malicious activity to senior management are not set too high; rather, they should be briefed on “near misses” as well as those intrusion attempts that succeed, as such near misses are among the most important signals to assess the quality of a company’s defenses and its reaction to incidents.Finally, board members should actively champion a model of collaboration over self-preservation—one where information about malicious activity is shared proactively with expectations that the government will be responsive and add value, and that industry will not suffer punitive sanction for sharing. As the nation’s cyber defense agency, CISA’s goal is to advance a new model of sustainable cybersecurity by working collaboratively with our partners to drive down risk to our nation, enabling the broader safety of consumers. The time is now for CEOs and Boards to actively embrace corporate cyber responsibility as a matter of good governance, recognizing that every organization has an obligation to reasonably assure the safety of their employees, partners, and customers.  This movement can start by ensuring that CEOs and Board Members are held personally accountable for effectively managing cyber risk and directly engaged when it comes to corporate cybersecurity decisions and the cybersecurity of their companies.  As NACD notes, security isn’t an IT function, but rather a culture and set of repeatable practices driven by the CEO and senior executives to reduce risk, wherein cyber literacy is considered like financial literacy: “Not everyone on the board is an auditor, but everyone should be able to read a financial statement and understand the financial language of business.”

Schools are pillars of our communities and often as the setting for the most formative experiences in a child’s life. In today’s environment, however, kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools face an evolving and dynamic set of security threats, ranging from acts of targeted violence to cyber incidents. CISA’s mission is to lead the national effort to understand, manage and reduce risks to the cyber and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every day. As part of this role, we established the School Safety Task Force (SSTF) to help strengthen the safety and security of K-12 schools across the country. Since its inception, the SSTF has worked closely with the broader school safety community to understand and address the unique needs of and challenges faced by the K-12 community. The program’s work centers around developing and deploying tailored and actionable resources, raising awareness about new and emerging threats and hazards, and coordinating federal government efforts to help schools and school districts create and maintain safe and supportive learning environments. One of the program’s key initiatives was the establishment of the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse). The Clearinghouse is an interagency effort among the U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Justice, that was created in the wake of the 2018 tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. The Clearinghouse’s public website, SchoolSafety.gov, serves as a one-stop access point for more than 750 resources, guidance and evidence-based practices on a range of school safety topics. The site also includes several tools to help members of the K-12 community prioritize school safety actions, find applicable resources and funding opportunities, connect with state and local school safety officials, and develop school safety plans. To further enhance the these efforts, the Department of Homeland Security established the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse External Advisory Board in 2024 to provide advice and recommendations on practical ways to enhance K-12 school safety and security. SSTF’s work is driven by the larger school safety community and its specific needs. To that end, we’ve developed several capacity-building products tailored for school communities. These include the K-12 Bystander Reporting Toolkit, which offers strategies for how schools can encourage bystander reporting among students and members of the school community, and the K-12 Anonymized Threat Response Guidance to help schools and their law enforcement and community partners create tailored approaches to addressing anonymous threats of violence. These types of products support K-12 communities in strengthening their prevention, protection and mitigation capabilities against some of the most pressing and prevalent threats. But it is not sufficient to just make resources available to the community. Ensuring the safety and security of schools is an imperative mission, and it requires continuous outreach, training and engagement. We aim to educate and equip K-12 communities with information on current and emerging threats through regular communications via social media channels, newsletters and publication of issue briefs on key school safety topics. In addition, we work directly with K-12 stakeholders through our field force across the country, participating in hundreds of local-, state-, and national-level conferences, and conducting trainings designed to address key school safety issues. We also annually convene the National Summit on K-12 School Safety and Security, welcoming thousands of school safety stakeholders from across the country to share information on the most critical and timely safety issues and explore research-informed strategies for addressing security challenges and risks.K-12 communities have made tremendous progress to enhance school safety, but we cannot afford to be complacent. As threats and challenges continue to evolve, CISA stands ready to support our country’s schools, districts, federal, state, local, tribal and territorial partners in addressing their unique needs and ultimately creating safer learning environments for students and teachers.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Cyber Civil Defense is a call to action across our Nation—government, industry, nonprofits, academia and individuals—to join forces to prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents. Cyber Civil Defense seeks to advance citizen cyber education, foster innovation in cyber tools, and build a unique cybersecurity workforce. By leveraging resources, thinking creatively, and promoting basic cybersecurity practices, we can better protect the nation from cyber actors who threaten our way of life. No single entity can secure the nation alone; it requires a unified effort. At CISA, we are committed to empowering communities to take an active role in safeguarding our shared digital future. As a key part of this work, we launched Secure Our World in 2023, our first-ever public awareness program, along with key partners across industry and the non-profit world, to help educate everyone about how they can be a part of our nation’s cyber defense in their ever day lives and in their organizations. The Secure Our World campaign centers around four simple steps to improve cyber hygiene: 1) Use Strong Passwords and a Password Manager; 2) Turn On Multifactor Authentication; 3) Recognize and Report Phishing, and 4) Update Software. It features extensive easy-to-use resources, including tipsheets and how-to guides, as well as a series of animated videos. Beyond Secure Our World, we’ve also championed the “Cyber Clinics” model as a promising, scalable solution for enhancing the cyber resilience of small organizations at the local level through the expertise of students studying to be the next generation of cyber defenders. Similar to free legal clinics which are staffed by law students, these cyber clinics help provide cybersecurity students hands-on experience by supporting their local communities with cyber support and guidance. In support of these efforts, we published a new guide in February 2024 highlighting CISA support available to cybersecurity clinics and their clients. It provides information related to informational briefings and partnerships, tools and services, and available grants. Our goal is to ensure that our partners have the right tools and resources to better protect and secure their respective communities. In addition to this work, as part of our High-Risk Communities Protection effort, we launched a resource webpage which includes a cyber volunteer portal that highlights several cybersecurity clinics across the country. The goal is to connect expert volunteers with organizations that would benefit from receiving these services. CISA also published a comprehensive cybersecurity toolkit to help high-risk organizations assess their cybersecurity posture and take actionable steps to enhance it. Finally, we launched Project Upskill, a program designed to empower vulnerable populations with straightforward guidance to strengthen their cybersecurity. Over the past year, we’ve taken this initiative nationwide, supporting regional events across the country to provide tailored support and deliver this critical guidance directly to at-risk communities.In a world increasingly reliant on technology, each of us plays a vital role in strengthening cyber resilience. By taking proactive steps—like the four simple steps of cyber hygiene; by encouraging universities to consider starting cyber clinics; or supporting high-risk communities—we can all Secure Our World.

During the holiday season, you may receive emails or text messages about a deal you just can’t miss, or an opportunity to give for charities you don’t recognize. Sadly, during this season of giving, we must all be on the lookout for scammers who use tactics like asking you to click on a link that installs malware on your device or creating a fake online store to trick you into buying from them, resulting in your money or even your identity being stolen. So how big of a problem are holiday online shopping scams? According to the FBI, almost 12,000 victims reported scams during the 2022 holiday shopping season, resulting in over $73 million in losses. The good news is that Secure Our World has tips to protect you and your family, friends and business from these scams.  To get started, take these steps before making any online purchases to help protect your devices, information and accounts against scammers: Update software to ensure your devices are protected against the latest threats Use strong passwords—at least 16 characters, random, and unique for each account Use a password manager to generate, save, and fill in strong passwords for you  Turn on multifactor authentication (MFA) for any account that offers it Check out our instructional videos for step-by-step guidance on how to secure devices and accounts.   Most successful cyberattacks start with a phishing email, and during the holiday shopping season, scammers ramp up their schemes. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered with a few tips to avoid the phish hook:  Beware of phishing messages—scammers are getting better and better at impersonating legitimate retailers Don’t click links or download attachments unless you’re sure of the sender Be wary of requests for information such as to confirm your delivery address Report scams to your email platform and then delete them And specifically for the holiday season, CISA recommends purchasing with confidence by: Choosing reputable vendors who encrypt your information Verifying business legitimacy through web searches and reviews Using credit, not debit, for greater protection against unauthorized charges Checking your accounts frequently for unauthorized charges We can all help one another stay safer online, so share these tips with a family member or friend!  It is just one more way we can help Secure Our World.  Visit our Holiday Online Shopping web page for additional tips and to learn more.

2025-07-25 22:11:31,393 - INFO - Đã crawl thành công: AI Red Teaming: Applying Software TEVV for AI Evaluations - Tác giả: treating AI TEVV as a subset of traditional software TEVV, the AI evaluations community benefits from using and building upon decades of proven and tested approaches towards assuring software is fit for purpose. Additionally, by streamlining processes, enterprises can avoid standing up parallel testing processes to accomplish similar ends, saving time and resources.Most notably, with the knowledge that software and AI TEVV must be treated similarly to software TEVV from a strategic and operational perspective, the digital ecosystem can instead channel effort at the tactical level, developing novel tools, applications, and benchmarks to robustly execute AI TEVV. 1 The US Department of Defense publications in the Rainbow Series in the 1980s represent major development in the history of cybersecurity guidance and requirements. See NSA/NCSC Rainbow Series.2 Some organizations approach software TEVV as a part of a broader product quality management regime, as defined by the processes and practices necessary for conformance with the ISO 9000 series of publications. For example, NIST SP 800-160r1 applies ISO 9000 definitions for validation and verification directly to the topic of engineering trustworthy, secure information systems. However, NIST SP 800-160r1 refers to a different ISO standard (29119-2:2021 – Software and systems engineering – Software testing) to define testing. There are several other documents referenced by SP 800-160r1 for evaluation criteria and processes. While SP 800-160r1 does not title itself a TEVV process manual, it does in fact define and inter-relate the processes for software testing, evaluation, validation, and verification.3 NIST defines “security” as resistance to intentional, unauthorized act(s) designed to cause harm or damage to a system; “safety” is a property of a system such that it does not, under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health, property, or the environment is endangered.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












As the saying goes, malicious actors don’t break in—they log in. There's a significant truth in that statement. Today, many organizations struggle to protect their staff from credential phishing, a challenge that's only grown as attackers increasingly execute “MFA bypass” attacks. In an MFA bypass attack, threat actors use social engineering techniques to trick victims into providing their username and password on a fake website. If victims are using “legacy MFA” (such as SMS, authenticator apps, or push notifications), the attackers simply request the MFA code or trigger the push notification. If they can convince someone to reveal two pieces of information (username and password), they can likely manipulate them into sharing three (username, password, and MFA code or action). Make no mistake—any form of MFA is better than no MFA. But recent attacks make it clear: legacy MFA is no match for modern threats. So, what can organizations do? Sometimes a case study can answer that question.Today, CISA and the USDA are releasing a case study that details the USDA’s deployment of FIDO capabilities to approximately 40,000 staff. While most of their staff have been issued government-standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smartcards, this technology is not suitable for all employees, such as seasonal staff or those working in specialized lab environments where decontamination procedures could damage standard PIV cards. This case study outlines the challenges the USDA faced, how they built their identity system, and their recommendations to other enterprises. Our personal favorite recommendation: "Always be piloting".FIDO authentication addresses MFA-bypass attacks by using modern cryptographic techniques built into the operating systems, phones, and browsers we already use. Single sign-on (SSO) providers and popular websites also support FIDO authentication. Here’s the remarkable part about FIDO: even if malicious actors craft a convincing scheme to steal staff credentials, and the staff comply, the attackers still won’t be able to compromise the account. The USDA’s success story should inspire all enterprises to migrate to FIDO authentication. Customers expect their providers to take security seriously, and given today’s threat landscape, organizations must ensure they are mitigating one of the most common and effective attack vectors.You can read the full case study here: Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Success Story: USDA’s Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) ImplementationFor more information, please see these other publications and resources: https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/phishing-resistant-mfa-key-peace-mindhttps://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/phishing-whats-namehttps://fidoalliance.org/https://fidoalliance.org/blog-fido-alliance-publishes-guidance-for-u-s-government-agency-deployment-of-fido-authentication/https://www.idmanagement.gov/playbooks/altauthn/

ScubaGear, a tool developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to automatically assess Microsoft 365 (M365) configurations for security gaps, hit a major milestone: more than 30,000 downloads since its debut in October 2022. In fact, downloads significantly increased with the recent release of ScubaGear version 1.3.0 in June 2024.  Security misconfigurations of settings within Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tenants can leave the system exposed to exploitation. During the first half of 2024, a major cloud vendor reported that these misconfigurations were found to be the initial access point for 30% of all cloud environment attacks. This is a significant jump from the second half of 2023, which traced 17% of attacks back to these misconfigurations. Avoidable misconfiguration vulnerabilities, such as not enabling multifactor authentication, could result in breaches, compromised data, and damaged customer trust.  ScubaGear rapidly and thoroughly analyzes an organization’s M365 tenant configuration. It then delivers actionable security change insights and recommendations that allow the tenant administrator to close security gaps and attain a stronger defense within their M365 environment.  The private sector, critical infrastructure and federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments use ScubaGear. The tool’s user-friendly reports map a course of corrective action that organizations can use to quickly identify and mitigate known configuration vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of costly breaches. One ScubaGear user from the Surface Transportation Board noted the assessment tool provided “excellent diagnostics, and the remediation steps outlined in the report were very clear and easy to understand.” ScubaGear has been updated nine times since its launch in 2022. Recent enhancements have made it more accessible and user-friendly. The tool is now available on PowerShell Gallery, which eases installation and lowers the user’s required technical skill to install and operate the tool.  Additionally, the Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) shared service launched a specific M365 FCEB Slack channel to provide support to federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies, enabling direct communications and real-time assistance. To learn more about how your organization can improve the security of its M365 tenant:  Download and run ScubaGear Join the M365 FCEB Slack channel (for FCEB agencies only)  Join the  ScubaGear GitHub platform  Additional ScubaGear updates are planned for 2024 and beyond to match the pace of vendor updates and, most importantly, to address emerging cloud security issues.

This includes school administrators, law enforcement personnel and mental health professionals.Engage law enforcement to manage threat situations and decide when to scale response actions up or down.Balance initial response steps to ensure the campus is safe. Most critically, treat each threat as credible, and from there, work with necessary partners to determine how to approach an immediate response.When appropriate, tap into multidisciplinary threat assessment teams to support interventions and expedite response if the subject who made the threat becomes known.Take steps throughout the school year to prepare for threats. Establish a response protocol and practice other types of emergency management activities, such as training exercises for staff.Today’s release also includes a supplemental reference guide that provides streamlined information for K-12 stakeholders to understand and utilize some of the best practices from the full toolkit. Both products were developed to support the diverse range of K-12 school settings across the United States and are based on current practices of K-12 organizations and law enforcement agencies.The new toolkit and guide were announced at CISA’s 2024 National Summit on K-12 School Safety and Security, an annual event that brings together K-12 school leaders and practitioners to discuss and share actionable recommendations that enhance safe and supportive learning environments.To learn more and access the K-12 Anonymized Threat Response Guidance, please click here. ###About CISA As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.Visit CISA.gov for more information and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Since 2021, industry and government have come together to forge persistent, trusted relationships that address our nation’s most urgent cybersecurity risks and drive long-term, proactive cyber defense planning. For the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), collaboration isn’t just an element of our name, it guides everything we do: JCDC’s mission is to unite the global cyber community in the collective defense of cyberspace. I’m immensely proud of how far we’ve come, how we’ve navigated challenges hand in hand with partners, and how we’ve operationalized the fundamental belief that we are stronger and more capable together. On this third anniversary, I want to recognize JCDC’s partners and supporters across the U.S. government, industry, and the globe—our teammates. You stand in the arena with us and face our most challenging adversaries with agility and resolve. Since our earliest days, beginning with the rapid response to the Log4Shell vulnerability, coordinated actions against the Daxin malware, and to establish Shields Up, we have matured and evolved this partnership.Currently, JCDC has welcomed more than 340 partners from industry and established over 40 collaboration channels. The vast majority of CISA’s cybersecurity advisories, guides, white papers, and fact sheets published in the last three years included actionable insights and expertise from JCDC partners. JCDC has shared a multitude of artifacts for joint analysis, coordinated cyber defense plans for three ongoing major geopolitical conflicts, and collaboratively executed a dozen other cyber defense plans. Some examples of JCDC efforts include the Pipelines Cyber Defense Planning Effort that led to new technical guidance and cooperation for owners, operators, and vendors. The Remote Monitoring and Management Cyber Defense Plan implements a clear roadmap to advance the security and resilience of vendors. JCDC shared key insights for joint products on the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored Volt Typhoon cyber threat activity and techniques, which continues to shape the public-private response. Helping to support an administrative initiative, the high-risk communities webpage assembles a wide range of free industry and government resources for civil society organizations at heightened risk of being targeted by cyber threat actors because of their identity or work.Recently, JCDC.AI spearheaded an AI tabletop exercise where more than 50 experts met to develop effective and coordinated responses to AI security incidents. Participants worked through operational considerations and information-sharing protocols for collaboration during a simulated cybersecurity incident involving an AI-enabled system. From this exercise, JCDC.AI is developing a first-of-its-kind AI Security Incident Collaboration Playbook that will lay the foundation for deeper partnership. Like any new team, JCDC has had some growing pains as we evolve, and as we bring in new teammates and learn how to collaborate to address evolving threats and emerging technology. Our JCDC core values of community, initiative, ingenuity, impact, and trust continue to propel this unique partnership between government and the private sector, powering an impact that is greater than its parts. I’m grateful for the contributions and capabilities of every part of JCDC and the ever-growing impact we’re having together. We’re not homogenous, and it’s not always harmonious, but it is the collective willingness to unify and operate with clarity of purpose that empowers JCDC to tackle today’s sophisticated cyber threat challenges.As we look ahead to JCDC 2024 priorities and beyond, I’m excited about the continued potential of JCDC to drive collective cyber defense, and I can’t wait for what comes next. JCDC is a public-private cybersecurity collaborative that leverages new authorities granted by Congress in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to unite the global cyber community in the collective defense of cyberspace. CISA welcomes all critical infrastructure organizations and entities with cybersecurity expertise and visibility to participate in our collaboration efforts.

Consumers, demanding security be built into the products and services they purchase, can function as the market signal, driving systemic changes across the software supplier ecosystem. “The anticipation for the release of Software Acquisition Guide not only garnered attention from Task Force members but also sparked an outpouring of interest from various stakeholders at the ICT SCRM Task Force Conference that took place on June 12, 2024,” said John Miller, Senior Vice President of Policy for Trust, Data, and Technology and General Counsel, Information Technology Industry (ITI) Council and ICT SCRM Task Force Co-Chair. “This Guide serves as a useful tool for customers of acquisition and procurement organizations who can use this guidance as a basis for describing, assessing, and measuring security practices relative to the software life cycle. A huge thank you to the Software Assurance Working Group for their work and diligence in creating such a thorough and groundbreaking document.”  The ICT SCRM Task Force also developed an accompanying Spreadsheet that complements the Software Acquisition Guide and assists users with navigating the document. The Task Force will host a webinar on the Software Acquisition Guide in the fall.  Registration information will be posted on the ICT SCRM Task Force website. ###About CISA As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.Visit CISA.gov for more information and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram.

The Playbook also includes a narrative hypothetical illustration of how a community might conduct resilience planning or incorporate infrastructure resilience into existing planning efforts using the IRPF.“Reading through the Playbook process, not only are the IRPF steps articulated with clear inputs and outputs but the additional guidance on resilience concepts will help communities increase their readiness and bounce back quickly after a disaster,” said Dr. David Mussington, CISA Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security. “We anticipate that the IRPF Playbook will address a crucial challenge by not only outlining the IRPF steps but also providing guidance on their practical implementation in disaster preparedness planning.”The nation’s capacity to secure its infrastructure and sustain essential community services also depends on SLTT and private sector partners working together to assess and reduce risk to increasingly complex natural and human threats. CISA is releasing the IRPF Playbook to share its expertise with the public and with private sector entities, which have the primary responsibility for planning, investing in, and maintaining multiple water, transportation, health, education and other facilities and recovering essential community services.The IRPF Playbook can be accessed alongside other resilience planning resources at the Resilience Planning Program webpage.

Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience 












CISA Releases the Latest Update to the Secure Tomorrow Series ToolkitCritical infrastructure owners and operators have a lot on their plate. Social, technological, economic, environmental, and political changes contribute to new and evolving risks at seemingly faster rates. Meanwhile, critical infrastructure owners and operators and their partners have operational, business, and other demands that compete with their time and ability to reflect on future resilience and security needs.With multiple risk factors and demands on everyone’s time, asking the right questions is critical to gaining better insights. While everyone wants to be ready for whatever’s coming on the horizon, having discussions around an uncertain future can feel daunting, and an unfocused approach can result in vague and nonactionable strategies that can leave organizations and their people less safe and less resilient.The Secure Tomorrow Series Toolkit is meant to help fill this gap by structuring and facilitating these discussions. Each year, CISA selects three topics with significant potential to disrupt multiple National Critical Functions and delves into how these topics might result in emerging and evolving risks that affect critical infrastructure resilience and security. CISA uses this knowledge base to build a toolkit of strategic foresight activities. The idea is to package proven methods, high quality prompts, and extensive supporting materials together, so that critical infrastructure partners can confidently bring together participants with domain-, regional-, and sector-specific expertise and productively arrive at risk mitigation strategies that are relevant and actionable. Secure Tomorrow Series Toolkit products help distill and distinguish real concerns arising from each topic, which participants then ground in the realities of their situations. Today’s update introduces three new topics: Information and communications technology supply chain resilienceAdvanced manufacturingWater availabilityThese topics add to the existing toolkit library that covers brain-computer interfaces, synthetic biology, quantum technologies, anonymity and privacy, trust and social cohesion, and data storage and transmission.Each toolkit activity is carefully designed to allow whoever is sponsoring an activity to engage with their critical infrastructure community in fun, challenging, and productive ways. From matrix games that can be played in a single morning or afternoon session, to one-day scenarios workshops that integrate multiple topics to highlight systems and emergent risks, the toolkit has activities targeted to different levels of participation and time commitment. The hope is that these activities lead to better insights on risk mitigation that participants can bring back to their organizations, while strengthening networks to engage in further planning and implementation.Download/share the Secure Tomorrow Series Toolkit.To learn more, visit the Secure Tomorrow Series webpage.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












The U.S. Senate first designated June as National Internet Safety Month in 2005, primarily to raise awareness of internet dangers and highlight the need for education about online safety, especially among young people. In the years since then, with the rise of smartphones, social media and other new technologies, the amount of time people spend online has grown enormously—as have the risks. Yet, as data from numerous studies show, the nation needs more education and training about the risks we face online and how to stay safe when using connected devices. Most of the time, cyberattacks occur due to poor cyber hygiene…the basics. Fortunately, there are four simple things we can all do to help protect ourselves and, by extension, others: Use strong passwords. “Strong” means at least 16 characters, random, and unique to each account. Use a password manager to automatically generate, store, and fill in passwords for you.Turn on multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA provides an extra layer of security in addition to a password when logging into accounts and apps, like a fingerprint, a code from an authenticator app, or a code sent to your phone. Enable it on any account that offers it, especially your email, social media, and financial accounts.Update software. When devices, apps, or software programs notify us that updates are available, install them as soon as possible. Updates fix security risks to better protect our data. Turn on automatic updates to make it even easier.Recognize and report phishing. Learn to recognize signs of phishing—messages designed to trick you into downloading malware (malicious programs) or giving personal information to a criminal. If an offer is too good to be true, it's probably social engineering. If the message is alarming and requires urgent action, it might be a phishing message.  Do not click or engage—report the phish and delete the message.CISA offers a variety of free resources to implement these steps and spread the word to friends and family. Our new cybersecurity awareness program Secure Our World provides many resources for improving online safety, such as short how-to videos on the four actions above, tip sheets in 10 languages, and more.As the school year ends, take this opportunity to discuss the importance of these basic precautions with family and friends. You wouldn’t drive your car without buckling your seatbelt.  I buckle my seatbelt so I can be safe. I ask passengers to do the same so they can be safe. If you take these four easy steps to better cyber hygiene when online, your family and the devices you use every day will be much safer and ready for summer fun in just a few minutes!!

Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience 












On April 30th, the White House released National Security Memorandum-22 (NSM) on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience, which updates national policy on how the U.S. government protects and secures critical infrastructure from cyber and all-hazard threats. NSM-22 recognizes the changed risk landscape over the past decade and leverages the enhanced authorities of federal departments and agencies to implement a new risk management cycle that prioritizes collaborating with partners to identify and mitigate sector, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk. The culmination of this cycle is the creation of the 2025 National Infrastructure Risk Management Plan (National Plan)—updating and replacing the 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan—and will guide federal efforts to secure and protect critical infrastructure over the coming years. As the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will develop this National Plan to be forward-looking and employ all available federal tools, resources, and authorities to manage and reduce national-level risks, including those cascading across critical infrastructure sectors. CISA will look to its partners to help us and the other Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) over the course of the year as we develop this foundational document. The National Plan Must Account for the Evolution of Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Consequences Building off the priorities of NSM-22, the 2025 National Plan will articulate how the U.S. government will collaborate with partners to identify and manage national risk. This will be an evolution from the 2013 National Plan which described risk management as “the cornerstone” to strengthening critical infrastructure security and resilience. Eleven years later, the spirit of this concept holds true; yet it must evolve due to pervasive vulnerabilities and an elevated threat landscape, which could lead to cascading regional and national consequences. Fortunately, over that same decade, Congress and successive administrations have established new agencies, authorities, and collaborative partnerships that empower a whole-of-society approach to national risk management. As the National Coordinator, CISA will be the primary driver for operationalizing this approach through the National Plan. The National Plan will be Informed by a New Risk Management CycleNSM-22 details a new risk management cycle that requires SRMAs to identify, assess, and prioritize risk within their respective sectors and develop sector risk management plans to address those risks. With these risk assessments and risk management plans, CISA will identify and prioritize systemic, cross-sector, and nationally significant risk through a cross-sector risk assessment. This assessment will enable CISA to prioritize systemic risk reduction efforts—detailed in the National Plan—that the U.S. government will take in collaboration with relevant federal, state and local, private, and international partners. Most importantly, the National Plan will recognize that the U.S. government cannot make all critical infrastructure immune from all threats and hazards. Rather, it will detail U.S. government efforts to make critical infrastructure resilient against prioritized risks based on the 16 sector’s risk assessments and CISA’s cross-sector risk assessments. All the while, CISA and other federal partners will work closely with SRMAs to manage their unique sector risks.  We Need You for Us to be Successful This will be a fundamentally new approach to U.S. government risk management. In this era of technological advancements and dynamic global volatility, the security and resilience of our critical infrastructure are of paramount importance. Essential systems, including energy grids, water systems, transportation networks, healthcare facilities, and communication systems, are vital for public safety, economic stability, and national security. The increasing interconnectivity of critical infrastructure systems, reliance upon global technologies and supply chains, and geopolitical tensions make these systems susceptible to a myriad of threats. Addressing these risks will require a coordinated national effort by federal agencies; State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments, infrastructure owners and operators, and other stakeholders across the critical infrastructure community. As those responsible for the security and resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure, we must collectively address emergent risks and an uncertain future while remaining vigilant against longstanding threats like terrorism, natural disasters, and targeted violence. Indeed, trusted, sustained, and effective partnerships between the federal government and private-sector and SLTT partners is the foundation of our collective effort to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure. Put simply, the 2025 National Plan will not succeed unless our partners collaborate with us to inform its development and its eventual implementation. We ask that you work with your respective SRMAs through the development of your sector risk assessments and sector risk management plans, as these will be core inputs into the National Plan. You can also contact us at sector.governance@cisa.dhs.gov for any of your ideas. These inputs will be invaluable as we develop a plan that allows the U.S. government to better prioritize our risk mitigation efforts and reduce risk for the critical infrastructure that underpin American society. For more information on the NSM-22 and CISA’s role as National Coordinator, visit CISA National Security Memorandum on Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience | CISA.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Cyber threat actors continue to infiltrate critical infrastructure networks with increased sophistication, persistence, and malicious intent. While some actors remain financially motivated, others such as nation-state actors aligned with the People’s Republic of China, aim to compromise U.S. critical infrastructure networks to potentially disrupt critical services in the event of a geopolitical conflict. Organizations need to be prepared to respond and remain resilient in the face of these challenging threats, and exercises, such as Cyber Storm, serve as a critical tool to enhance preparedness. A few weeks ago, approximately one hundred exercise planners convened at CISA headquarters for the ninth iteration of the national cyber exercise, Cyber Storm. The planners, representing private industry, federal, state, and international government partners, managed an exercise that spanned across the globe to simulate a coordinated cyberattack targeting critical infrastructure. What sets Cyber Storm apart from other cyber exercises is the depth and breadth of the exercise.  We hosted over 2,200 participants from 300 organizations from more than 80 private sector companies, 35 federal departments and agencies, 11 states, and nine partner countries. It provided an immersive experience for participants to engage in all aspects of cyber incident response through three days of live exercise play. The exercise scenario centered on adversary exploitation of common misconfigurations of cloud environments to cause various impacts to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Initial impacts occurred within the Food and Agriculture Sector but ultimately impacted many organizations across multiple sectors.Our planners enhanced the realism of the exercise through simulating traditional and social media websites, as well as creating a simulated dark web. Additionally, Cyber Storm IX simulated enemies who employed tactics, techniques, and procedures used by real-world adversaries.  The simulated threat actors had an agenda with sufficient resources to carry out the attacks to meet the exercise’s objectives.Cyber Storm gave the participants an opportunity to exercise organizational response plans and capabilities, foster relationships with counterparts, and improve organizational and national cyber readiness and resilience. Participating organizations worked directly with CISA and coordinating bodies such as Sector Risk Management Agencies and Information Sharing and Analysis Centers to understand roles and capabilities during a cyberattack.  Outcomes from Cyber Storm IX will be published later this year at Cyber Storm: Securing Cyber Space | CISA. CISA will continue to assist stakeholders with end-to-end exercise development support upon request to increase resilience to both physical and cyber threats.

2025-07-25 22:14:32,742 - INFO - Đã crawl thành công: Categorically Unsafe Software - Tác giả: looking at trends, we can start to see which software companies are making progress and which need to initiate a quality improvement program. Generalizing remedies. By thinking about classes of defect, we can think beyond the symptom of the problem, and start to reason more about ways to generalize remedies. This line of thinking also serves to shift the responsibility of security from the least capable to the most equipped. Instead of software developers asking, “How can I fix this one defect?” they can ask “How can I prevent all similar defects?” Rather than fixing one SQL injection (SQLi) defect, why not eliminate them entirely, as some companies appear to have done? Remediation scale. Some classes of coding error can be eliminated with relatively low effort, while some may require significant effort. Until we learn how widespread various classes of defect are, we won’t be able to distinguish between classes of defect that companies should eliminate on their own, and those that require a coordinated effort by the larger software ecosystem.Shift left. In the context of software development, people use the phrase “shift left” to mean conducting certain activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Part of the idea is that preventing coding mistakes is cheaper than catching and fixing them later in the timeline. The phrases “shift left” and “eliminating classes of vulnerability” are different sides of the same coin. If you truly align your product security program to prevent defects as early in the development cycle as possible, meaning that you are shifting security left on a timeline, you must contemplate ways to eliminate entire classes of coding error.Developer ecosystems. Google’s March 2024 whitepaper titled “Secure by Design at Google” includes this important observation: “The security posture of software products and services is an emergent property of the developer ecosystem in which they are designed, implemented and deployed”. They further write that “careful design of developer ecosystems can drastically lower the incidence of certain kinds of defects, and in some cases practically eliminate them”. The idea is that repeated types of software defects are not the fault of the individual software developer. That means that “developer training” might not be the best remedy. Instead, they argue, those repeat offender defects are an emergent property of the tools and practices that the company has given their coders. Some tools make it nearly impossible for the developer to avoid coding errors. As one example, see the prevalence of memory safety defects in languages like C/C++ compared to others like Swift, C#, Java, Rust, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Ruby. CostsReducing costs to software manufacturers. Software defects can be reported at random times. Pulling software developers off other tasks to address software defects can be expensive and disruptive to project schedules. As any business looks to save where it can, it is useful to examine the costs of insecurity to the company. To instead achieve economies of scale, companies should invest in the tools and resources needed to prevent the introduction of entire classes of defect and achieve secure outcomes like secure developer ecosystems.Reducing costs to the customers. Applying software updates is not a trivial matter in businesses, small or large – not to mention the costs of an intrusion. We now know that security will not be achieved by simply “patching harder.” Therefore, reducing the number of critical security fixes can reduce the load on IT professionals, and improve customer security.Increasing costs to the threat actors. When we eliminate entire classes of defect, we make it harder for threat actors to exploit simple vulnerabilities. That raises their cost to conduct malicious cyber activity. If product teams eliminate enough of the classic defects, they may price some threat actors out of the market. Aren’t we doing that already?Some software companies are already working to eliminate classes of coding error. Some have even accomplished that goal for the most common classes. But there is evidence that the industry as a whole is not making sufficient progress. In fact, many top software products fail to protect their customers from exploitation of the most common classes of defect. We read in the news about these common defects causing significant damage to companies and government agencies.Let’s compare two documents, MITRE’s 2007 paper titled, “Unforgivable Vulnerabilities”, and their 2023 analysis of “Stubborn Weaknesses”. It would be a reasonable hope that the classes of defect from 2007 would have been eliminated and that the 2023 report would have all new classes of defect that are more expensive to exploit. We would hope that the software industry would eliminate top classes of defect every few years because doing so would increase the cost to threat actors.Sadly, the truth is that the software industry has made inadequate progress since 2007, the year the iPhone was introduced. Of the 13 “unforgivable vulnerabilities”, most are still present in the 2023 report in one form or another. We are still plagued by classes of defect like memory unsafety, XSS, SQL injection, directory traversal, and improper input sanitization. What’s especially noteworthy is that for most of these classes of defect, we have known of ways to prevent them at scale for years, and even decades. Some damaging and costly cyber intrusions were likely preventable.Over the past 17+ years, many software companies have prioritized fixing software defects found in customer deployments over fixing them in their product designs, thereby putting customers at risk and leading to significant real-world harms.The CWE/CPE challengeThe above two reports rely on the Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) program, and in particular, CVE Numbering Authorities’ (CNA) commitment to provide timely, complete, and correct CVE records. Especially important to root cause analysis are the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) fields. The CWE explains the type of coding error that created the defect. The CPE provides information about product and platform naming. Today, some CNAs ensure CWE and CPE fields are included with all CVE records they create, but many are not as diligent. Until all CNAs and software manufacturers fully commit themselves to ensuring that their CVE records (and CWE/CPE fields) are timely, complete, and correct, we will struggle to become a data-driven industry. Incomplete or inaccurate data will keep us in the dark about the root causes of cyber intrusions and inhibit our ability to prevent them at scale. But we’re seeing signs of progress. Recently Microsoft announced that they would “now publish root cause data for Microsoft CVEs using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) industry standard”. Their blog post is worth reading to understand their perspective. This development — and the commitment of 68 software manufacturers as part of our pledge to do the same — is exciting, and we hope all CNAs and software manufacturers follow suit. ConclusionThe next time you see a security-sensitive update for a software product, don’t focus on how the threat actors are abusing that specific coding error. Ask yourself what class of coding error it belongs to. If it belongs to one of the “unforgivable vulnerabilities” from the 2007 paper, or one of the recurring “stubborn weaknesses”, ask yourself why the software manufacturer shipped the product with that defect when systemic preventions are well-known. More importantly, ask those software companies what they are doing to eliminate that entire class of defect. As customers, we should demand that companies stop the practice of shipping defective software, and then only fixing the problems that are found in the field, often after a customer has been injured. The bottom line is that a secure by design software development program necessitates formal efforts to eliminate entire classes of defect before the product ships rather than playing whack-a-mole with defects that appear on customer systems in production. For the software manufacturer, a secure by design program that works to eliminate entire classes of defect is likely to be cheaper in the long run and will create a higher quality product that requires fewer emergency fixes. Such a program should be part of the company’s business strategy. For the customers, it will reduce the burden of having to apply as many urgent software updates. For our country, it will result in greater security and safety. It is the norm in other industries to perform root cause analysis and to work towards eliminating classes of defect and it is long past time for it to be the norm in the software industry.For more information on developing software that is secure by design, please see CISA’s Secure by Design whitepaper. We encourage all software manufacturers to demonstrate their commitment by taking CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge.

Participating software manufacturers are pledging to work over the next year to demonstrate measurable progress towards seven concrete goals. Collectively, these commitments will help protect Americans by securing the technology that our critical infrastructure relies on.“A more secure by design future is indeed possible. The items in the pledge directly address some of the most pervasive cybersecurity threats we at CISA see today, and by taking the pledge software manufacturers are helping raise our national cybersecurity baseline,” CISA Senior Technical Advisor Jack Cable said. “Every software manufacturer should recognize that they have a responsibility to protect their customers, contributing to our national and economic security. I appreciate the leadership of those who signed on and hope that every technology manufacturer will follow suit.”The seven goals of the pledge are:Multi-factor authentication (MFA). Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the use of multi-factor authentication across the manufacturer’s products.Default passwords. Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate measurable progress towards reducing default passwords across the manufacturers’ products.Reducing entire classes of vulnerability. Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken towards enabling a significant measurable reduction in the prevalence of one or more vulnerability classes across the manufacturer’s products.Security patches. Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate actions taken to measurably increase the installation of security patches by customers.Vulnerability disclosure policy. Within one year of signing the pledge, publish a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) that authorizes testing by members of the public on products offered by the manufacturer, commits to not recommending or pursuing legal action against anyone engaging in good faith efforts to follow the VDP, provides a clear channel to report vulnerabilities, and allows for public disclosure of vulnerabilities in line with coordinated vulnerability disclosure best practices and international standards.CVEs. Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate transparency in vulnerability reporting by including accurate Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) fields in every Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) record for the manufacturer’s products. Additionally, issue CVEs in a timely manner for, at minimum, all critical or high impact vulnerabilities (whether discovered internally or by a third party) that either require actions by a customer to patch or have evidence of active exploitation.Evidence of intrusions. Within one year of signing the pledge, demonstrate a measurable increase in the ability for customers to gather evidence of cybersecurity intrusions affecting the manufacturer’s products.Each goal has core criteria which manufacturers are committing to work towards, in addition to context and example approaches to achieve the goal and demonstrate measurable progress. To enable a variety of approaches, software manufacturers participating in the pledge have the discretion to decide how best they can meet and demonstrate the core criteria of each goal, but progress should be demonstrated in public.CISA’s global Secure by Design initiative, launched last year, implements the White House’s National Cybersecurity Strategy by shifting the cybersecurity burden away from end users and individuals to technology manufacturers who are most able to bear it. CISA urges software manufacturers to review CISA’s Secure by Design guidance and Secure by Design alerts to build security into their products.To date, the following 68 companies have signed the pledge: 1touch.io, Akamai, Amazon Web Services, Apiiro, Armis, Automox, BigID, BlackBerry, Bugcrowd, Chainguard, Cisco, Claroty, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, Cybeats, Resilience, ESET, Everfox, Finite State, Forescout, Fortinet, Gigamon, GitHub, GitLab, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HiddenLayer, HP, Huntress, IBM, Infoblox, InfoSec Global, Ivanti, Kiteworks, Lasso Security, Lenovo, Manifest, Microsoft, N-able, NetApp, Netgear, Okta, Palo Alto Networks, Pangea, Proofpoint, Qualys, Rapid7, Red Queen Dynamics, Scale AI, Secureworks, Securin, Security Compass, SentinelOne, Socket, Sonatype, Sophos, Tenable, ThreatQuotient, ThriveDX, Tidelift, Trellix, Trend Micro, Vanta, Veracode, Veritas Technologies LLC, Wiz, Xylem, and Zscaler.Learn more about this voluntary pledge and sign it today by visiting: cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge.### About CISA As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.Visit CISA.gov for more information and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram.

This year, during National Small Business Week, we celebrate the more than 32 million small businesses that are the backbone of our economy and so often the heart of our communities. Whether these businesses are found in small towns, big cities, or places in between, there are practical steps you can take to secure them against cyberattacks. As many of us have seen in the news or witnessed firsthand, cyberattacks like ransomware can abruptly shut down a small business--utterly devastating its owners, employees, and customers; sometimes even impacting the larger community.They are the target of cyber criminals because small businesses don’t always have the resources to invest in cybersecurity. So, during this year’s National Small Business Week (April 28-May 4), I am personally inviting you to use the many free resources offered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to create cyber safety habits that will help you Secure Your Business. To get started, implement these four simple cybersecurity steps:Train staff to recognize phishing. Emphasize the harm phishing emails can cause while educating employees on what to look for in a phishing email and encouraging everyone to think before they click on any links or attachments.  Require strong passwords. As the first line of defense in stopping criminals from accessing accounts, passwords should be random, unique, and at least 16 characters long. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts and enable an enterprise-level password manager so that the only password you need to remember is the one for the password manager.  Require multifactor authentication (MFA). MFA requires more than a password to access your accounts, such as a texted code, biometric scan, or access card. With more than 310 million smartphone users in the U.S., it’s easy to use a smartphone or tablet to implement MFA. Update any software used for business. Out-of-date software is easily exploited to steal business, employee, and customer data. Enable automatic software updates on connected devices used for business so they automatically get the latest security patches. It is also incredibly important to be aware of any outdated or unsupported software or hardware, so make sure to inventory and update them.You can find additional online resources by visiting Secure Our World Secure Our World, CISA’s enduring, year-round cybersecurity awareness program that uses creative campaigns to teach the American public easy ways to stay safe online. We continually release new content so bookmark the page, revisit it often, and share the messaging with your employees, your friends and family, and throughout your business community. If you’re looking for CISA resources closer to home, CISA has regional offices throughout the U.S. where our field personnel provide a variety of risk management and response services to help businesses become more resilient to cyber and physical threats.In addition to these perennial resources, this year, CISA is also hosting a virtual booth at the National Small Business Week Virtual Summit where registered attendees can access resources to boost their cyber resiliency. Hosted by the U.S. Small Business Administration and SCORE, the April 30 – May 1 summit recognizes America’s small businesses for their hard work, ingenuity, and dedication and will feature educational workshops, networking opportunities, and access to other federal resources. If you’re attending, be sure to check out the CISA booth.Additionally, every year in October, we work with our voluntary partners—who are critical to our mission and our shared success—to lead the nation in celebrating Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Want to become a Cybersecurity Awareness Month Partner? Email us at Awareness Campaigns. As you consider which combination of resources will best help you start or expand your small businesses’ cybersecurity practices, I also encourage you to make it a point to talk about cybersecurity to your entire organization, no matter the size. Having these conversations helps establish a culture of security—making cybersecurity the everyday activity it needs to be to Secure Your Business and Secure Our World.Alaina R. Clark is Assistant Director for Stakeholder Engagement at CISA.

Shifting the balance of cybersecurity risk from small organizations and consumers to technology providers and software developers is a priority for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Consistent with the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s goal of rebalancing the risks of insecure software, "Software Understanding" seeks to understand software’s potential behavior before the software is placed into use. Software Understanding compliments CISA’s Secure by Design initiative by enhancing software analysis. Software that is secure by design is designed for analysis – that is, designed to support independent efforts to scrutinize software artifacts to verify and validate the software before it is placed into use.  When your mission is national security or critical infrastructure, you need to do more than just trust; you need the ability to subject executable software to additional scrutiny before it is deployed. Together, Software Understanding and Secure by Design promise to give technology customers and end users additional tools to be able to demand better cybersecurity from their software developers.Last year, CISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) convened a government-wide workshop on Software Understanding for National Security (SUNS) hosted by the DHS Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate. The purpose of the workshop was to explore the potential development of additional automated tools that would enable integrators and users of software to gain understanding without needing to rely so heavily on manual analysis, such as reverse engineering. A post-meeting report, which also contains findings and information on agency participation, summarizes the individual views of subject matter experts regarding:   The need and challenge of analyzing software artifacts and their potential behaviors, Impediments and catalysts to a future state for automated software analysis, andEstablishing a government-wide community of software understanding researchers.  Software Understanding is a difficult problem, but as workshop participants highlighted, much can likely be accomplished with comprehensive approaches to addressing the problem. CISA is committed to shepherding the development of Software Understanding and plans to lead another SUNS workshop this spring. For more on this effort, visit SUNS webpage.

Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware,                                                                                 Cyber Threats and Advisories 












Ransomware continues to evolve as a scourge on critical services, businesses, and communities worldwide, causing costly incidents that are increasingly destructive and disruptive. Based on recent industry reporting, it costs businesses an average of $1.85 million to recover from a ransomware attack.1 In addition, 80% of victims who paid a ransom were targeted and victimized again by these criminals.2 The economic, technical, and reputational impacts of ransomware incidents, throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery, continue to pose a challenge for organizations large and small. To directly reduce the attack surface and impact of ransomware attacks, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) focuses on proactive risk reduction through direct communication with federal government, state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) government, and critical infrastructure entities to prevent threat actors from accessing and deploying ransomware on their networks. Aligned with the Joint Ransomware Task Force, this pilot provides timely notification to critical infrastructure organizations to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect their networks and systems by using existing services, data sources, technologies, and authorities.  A key service used for warning organizations of ransomware-related vulnerabilities is our Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning, which monitors internet connected devices for known vulnerabilities and is available to any organization. Organizations participating in this no-cost service typically reduce their risk and exposure by 40% within the first 12 months and most see improvements in the first 90 days. Because the service looks for exposed assets, whether planned or inadvertent, it identifies vulnerabilities that would otherwise go unmanaged. For its use in support of RVWP, it informs organizations of those vulnerabilities commonly associated with known ransomware exploitation.  For Calendar Year (CY) 2023, RVWP completed 1,754 notifications to entities operating an internet-accessible vulnerable device. Following notification of the vulnerabilities, CISA regularly conducts vulnerability scans to determine whether the entities appear to have mitigated their vulnerable devices. Our findings indicated that 852 of the 1,754 notifications (49%) of vulnerable devices were either patched, implemented a compensating control, or taken offline after notification from CISA. Our regional teams work closely with notified entities in order to drive timely mitigation.  Critical Infrastructure SectorTotalsChemical15Commercial34Communications15Critical Manufacturing69Defense Industrial Base12Emergency Services17Energy173Financial Services127Food and Agriculture54Government Facilities641*Healthcare and Public Health440Information Technology64Transportation83Water and Wastewater10Totals1,754Table 1: RVWP Notification Breakdown by CI Sector *Value includes notifications for K-12 schools and districts, higher education facilities, SLTT government organizations, and U.S federal agencies.  The RVWP program enables organizations from all critical infrastructure sectors to harden their networks with respect to the vulnerabilities that ransomware gangs are known to use. As a result, it reduces the effectiveness of ransomware gang tools and procedures. With RVWP we are increasing their operational costs and contributing to deterrence by denial.   Giving organizations an opportunity to mitigate known vulnerabilities on their internet exposed devices also significantly helps organizations reduce their likelihood of a cyber incident. Currently, CISA Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning has more than 7,600 organizations across all sectors and has identified more than 3M known vulnerabilities for participants since 2022. By partnering with CISA in this service you're not just securing your digital assets; you're making a no-cost, low-risk strategic choice to achieve measurable improvements and proactively protect your business's reputation and future!  We urge organizations to take the following actions to help #StopRansomware: Enroll in the no-cost CISA Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning, it's not just about pinpointing vulnerabilities; it's helping organizations raise their cybersecurity posture and reduce business risk.  Review the #StopRansomware Guide, which includes a valuable and very useful checklist on how to respond to a ransomware incident and protect your organization.   Always report observed ransomware activity, including indicators of compromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), to CISA and our federal law enforcement partners.   [1] Sophos, rep.

In emergencies, maintaining open lines of communication is not just challenging—it's crucial. Congested networks can hamper rescue and relief efforts, making a difficult situation even more dire. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) offers three Priority Telecommunications Services that enable essential personnel to communicate when networks are degraded or congested due to weather events, mass gatherings, cyberattacks, or events stemming from human error. This April is Emergency Communications Month, and CISA is encouraging organizations responsible for our critical infrastructure sectors to significantly bolster their communications resiliency and emergency preparedness by enrolling in priority services. GETS and WPS are offered at no charge, require no special equipment, and can work separately or together to achieve a call completion rate greater than 90%, even during emergencies. WPS prioritizes calls when cellular networks are degraded or congested. GETS prioritizes calls when landline networks are degraded or congested, and they can be made from phones worldwide. The two services can even be used together on mobile phones in one convenient app called the PTS Dialer, which can be programmed to easily make a priority call in just a few clicks. To begin the enrollment process, visit https://www.cisa.gov/apply-pcs, and join us on April 30th for an informational webinar where we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the GETs and WPS services and how to get your organization started. No matter what vital industry you represent, adding priority services to your emergency communications plan is one of the easiest ways to ensure seamless communications when they are needed most.

Emergency Communications 












Each April, CISA celebrates Emergency Communications Month and spotlights the critical role of emergency communications in safeguarding our nation. Critical messages are being sent and received every minute of every day across the airwaves and the wires that crisscross this country. Each message, whether it is national security communications or a call to 911, is crucial to the citizens counting on the message to reach its destination. This is the importance of emergency communications; it is the foundation of a resilient community. We face a world of increasing and evolving threats impacting emergency communications from a multitude of sources:  natural, man-made, physical, and cyber. As a nation, we are collectively working to build resilience across industries and our communities in the face of these threats. Building resilience into emergency communications is at the root of everything we do.The importance of emergency communications is personal to me. As an active volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I have witnessed firsthand the critical moments when a 911 call becomes a lifeline for someone facing potentially the worst day of their life. When I enter a burning building, it is the clarity and reliability of emergency communications that serve as my lifeline. In the aftermath of a devastating storm, emergency communications are the community’s lifeline. Our collective reliance on emergency communication isn’t about convenience; it is a matter of life and death.At CISA, we recognize we can’t do this alone. Our partnerships across the public safety community, through SAFECOM and NCSWIC, ensure that our efforts are nationally aligned with emergency response providers across federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and international borders. As an emergency response provider, I am thankful for CISA’s dedication to working with stakeholders and see myself represented in these bodies. Building resilient communications takes work, and at CISA we are positioned to help our stakeholders and partners build more resilient communications by focusing on interoperability, collaborative communications planning, and expanding the priority service capability. These three functions are essential to provide emergency communications for all emergency preparedness stakeholders. Each of us must examine our methods of communicating during times of crisis or when communicating mission-critical information. Incorporating elements such as adopting Priority Services or developing a PACE Plan in order to ensure our transmissions reach their intended destination, will make our operations more effective. CISA offers technical assistance to assist emergency communicators and advance public safety interoperable communications capabilities resiliency. Resources such as the NIFOG and developments such as the transition to NG911 or the updates to NIMS/ICS to include the Information and Communications are all examples of the ongoing commitment CISA has to continuing to promote the advancement of our nation’s resilient communications.The citizens of our great nation deserve the best service that our public safety, critical infrastructure, and national security services can provide. For those services to operate at peak performance, emergency communications must flow seamlessly.  This April, join me in showing appreciation for the successful 911 call, the firefighter's connection on their radio, and the critical infrastructure operator's restoration of service. Each of those communications affects someone’s life in ways beyond what we may ever know, and each one of them matters. Communications interoperability is a challenge CISA works to tackle every day, and we are making tremendous strides toward being more resilient, together.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Last fall, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (UK-NCSC) held the first international convening of the Strategic Dialogue on Cybersecurity of Civil Society Under Threat of Transnational Repression. With the convening eight countries, we discussed options to advance the cybersecurity of civil society and calibrate our agencies’ support to the communities at highest risk. The second meeting is planned for May 2024.    Recently, CISA participated in the third Summit for Democracy in Seoul, South Korea, as part of our continuing commitment to counter cybersecurity threats against civil society. In alignment with this summit and our strategic dialogue work, CISA is providing a suite of resources on our new High-Risk Communities webpage today to help civil society organizations with bolstering their cyber defense and resilience.   These resources are the product of a year-long effort spearheaded by the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative in partnership with industry and civil society. Informed by the unique expertise and experiences of our civil society and industry partners, these resources directly respond to the unique threat profile and operational realities of high-risk organizations that are targeted by sophisticated threat actors.  As leaders of high-risk organizations know all too well, operating a robust cybersecurity program can be costly. And many sources of funding do not account for the cost of hiring and retaining information security professionals or implementing effective cybersecurity solutions. At the same time, civil society organizations and their affiliates are at heightened risk of becoming targets of Advanced Persistent Threats – and cybersecurity incidents that lead to disruptions in their work can have dire ramifications for the vulnerable communities they serve.  Here are some of the resources that CISA released today as part of its cyber defense plan to support civil society organizations:   Launch a CISA.gov Webpage for High-Risk Communities.  CISA’s High-Risk Communities webpage serves as a one-stop-shop for cybersecurity guidance and free or discounted tools and resources that are tailored to meet the needs of high-risk organizations that want to improve their cybersecurity baseline while operating with limited resources.   Release Project Upskill: CISA’s Tailored Cybersecurity Guidance for High-Risk Communities. Research from the CyberPeace Institute shows that less than 15-percent of non-governmental civil society organizations have cybersecurity experts on their staff and 33-percent do not have dedicated IT or security resources available to secure their individual employees, let alone the enterprise. That means employees at high-risk organizations serve as the first line of defense against malicious cyber actors that seek to disrupt operations or conduct reconnaissance.  Project Upskill is designed to arm individuals employed by or supporting high-risk organizations with simple steps to meaningfully improve their cyber hygiene. We crafted it to be accessible to a non-technical audience so that all individuals across civil society are empowered to support their own cyber defense.  The steps outlined in this new resource are not a “silver bullet” against cyber intrusions however, they can make it more difficult and costly for malign cyber actors to target individuals and the organization.   Highlight Free Tools & Services for Mission-Based Organizations.  Collectively, a wide array of free or discounted tools and services are available to high-risk communities. For example, certain organizations can apply to receive free cybersecurity protection under Cloudflare’s Project Galileo. Individuals who enroll in Google’s Advanced Protection Program (free to the public) benefit from additional account safeguards, including enhanced protection against phishing attempts and harmful downloads. Organizations seeking guidance on how to harden their enterprise will benefit from visiting the Global Cyber Alliance’s Cybersecurity Toolkit for Mission-Based Organizations, and high-risk individuals and organizations can turn to Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline for support with incident response if they believe they have been compromised.   All of these resources, and more, are located on CISA’s High-Risk Communities webpage.     Help Prospective Volunteers Connect with their Local Cyber Volunteer Clinic. Across the United States, academic institutions, non-profits, and municipalities are setting up cybersecurity clinics and volunteer corps to provide free, hands-on support for incident response and resilience building.   High-risk organizations often qualify for support from these volunteer clinics. Therefore, CISA is building a webpage that will have information about the cyber volunteer programs across the country. Our intent is to help build capacity by providing a centralized place for prospective volunteers to learn about prerequisites and application processes for joining their local cyber volunteer program, and help qualifying organizations learn how to obtain assistance.   At the third Summit for Democracy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated, “As authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms.” We believe that the work initiated through this partnership across civil society, technology companies, the US government, and international partner governments we are contributing to a rights respecting digital world.”  Disclaimer CISA does not endorse any commercial entity, product, company, or service, including any entities, products, or services referenced or linked to on this page. Any reference to specific commercial entities, products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by CISA.  ###

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Businesses, communities, and families across America depend on the reliable availability of oil and natural gas for countless functions of everyday life. Recognizing the criticality of the oil and natural gas (ONG) subsector to our shared security and prosperity, over 25 ONG organizations—with an emphasis on high-throughput midstream natural gas pipeline owner-operators–and their industrial control systems (ICS) vendors convened through the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to undertake the 2023 JCDC Pipelines Cyber Defense Planning Effort.The 2023 JCDC Pipelines Cyber Defense Planning Effort was a novel approach to bring together pipeline owner-operators and their ICS vendors, in partnership with the Transportation Security Administration and Department of Energy, to address shared challenges – whether ransomware incidents like the 2021 intrusion into Colonial Pipeline or persistent targeting by threat actors like the People’s Republic of China who possess the capability to disrupt natural gas pipelines, as highlighted in the ODNI 2023 Annual Threat Assessment. An effective response to these threats demands public-private collaboration efforts to defend pipeline networks against compromise and ensure that they continue to function in a worst-case scenario.This effort resulted in a detailed by-industry, for industry network architecture diagram and adjoining principles, the ONG Pipelines Reference Architecture. Pipeline owner-operators and ICS vendors built this architecture to serve as a voluntary model to guide their investment, planning, and operations as they work to better segment their networks and mitigate intrusion campaigns. The ONG Pipelines Reference Architecture offers practical guidance for stepping up risk management and showcases the interplay between network segmentation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), external dependencies, and critical field devices. For more information on the ONG Pipelines Reference Architecture, please contact the ONG Sector Coordinating Council .By organizing collaboration between midstream pipeline owner-operators and ICS vendors, this cyber defense planning effort facilitated a foundation for industry to proactively take transformative steps to harden the digital networks that run our nation’s largest natural gas pipelines against compromises – an example of the vision first established by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission and codified by Congress to catalyze cyber defense planning that yields real change in our nation’s cybersecurity.Here are some comments from a few organizations that participated in this planning effort:"Participating on the PRA project was an exciting opportunity to showcase security best practices used by both large and small pipeline operators as well as key vendors in that space. It was a great example of how government and industry collaboration can produce a quality product that can be used by ONG operators and vendors to incorporate sound and tested network design principles into their own environments."Rob MimsDirector of Security – Gas, Nuclear, and ElectricSouthern Company Gas“JCDC genuinely listened to stakeholders and fostered a constructive environment benefitting the common good and advancing our nation’s security posture.”Kimberly DenbowVice President of Security & OperationsAmerican Gas Association“Thanks for inviting Emerson to be a part of the team developing the PRA. The opportunity to work with a diverse group of industry specialists has proven insightful, as well as achieving the primary aims of developing an approach to securing pipeline operations. I think that much of the work that has been done as by this group will have application beyond the pipeline industry. Many thanks to JCDC for facilitating this, and bringing together the team that did it.”Steve HillDirector of SCADA SolutionsEmerson Automation Solutions“There are many public/private partnerships Kinder Morgan participates in, and our collective efforts between industry, government and vendors on these important initiatives provided meaningful and actionable results. Kinder Morgan is a strong supporter of CISA and JCDC; this was a productive use of our time.”Craig BarrettVice President of CybersecurityKinder Morgan“INGAA is grateful for the engagement between our member companies and CISA on this important effort, which we feel confident will support industry-wide collective defense efforts. Many of our members contributed significant time and resources to developing this PRA and we are glad to see those efforts come to fruition.”Maggie O'ConnellDirector of Security, Reliability, and ResilienceInterstate Natural Gas Association of America

Through continued collaborative efforts by both the Federal Government and the private sector, we will foster a more secure cyberspace.

Election Security 












Yesterday, we brought together security experts from across CISA, federal government partners, election non-profit organizations, and other election infrastructure stakeholders in our election operations center for one purpose: to provide election officials across the country with maximum support to ensure the security and integrity of the electoral process. From Maine to Alaska to American Samoa, millions of Americans headed to the polls on this year’s Super Tuesday to cast their vote. They were only able to exercise this constitutional right because of the planning, dedication, and service of election officials in our communities nationwide.The electoral process is the cornerstone of our democracy, and state and local election officials are the frontline defenders of this process. This is an increasingly important charge given the diverse and evolving threat environment of cyber, physical, and operational risks.  But, as yesterday demonstrates, they’re not facing this challenge alone. At CISA, election security is a top agency priority, and we are proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the nation’s election officials to provide the support and services they need to accomplish this mission.  With the 2024 primary season in full swing, CISA is focused on doing more to meet election officials where they are. We have tailored our support to effectively meet their unique jurisdictional needs. We have been making sustained investment in expanding our field staff for maximum impact. Last year we took this a step further, establishing election security advisors dedicated to this mission across all ten regions. We are proud to have this team of incredible public servants and seasoned election administrators fully on board, bringing with them over 200 years of collective election administration and election technology experience. These election security advisors join a cadre of CISA protective security advisors and cybersecurity advisors, who are already meeting with election infrastructure stakeholders to share information; conduct cyber and physical security assessments of election facilities; and offer resources, training, and access to other CISA products and services.Another way we are ensuring our resources and recommendations are as accessible as possible is our new election security resources webpage, #Protect2024 on CISA.gov. The page is a one-stop resource hub of security best practices, CISA security services, and CISA training resources, along with a library of helpful security guidance covering cyber, physical and operational risks to election infrastructure.The 2024 election cycle presents an increasingly complex threat landscape for election infrastructure and election officials. But that’s ok—we are ready for it. The American elections process is resilient, thanks in large part to the dedication of the state and local election officials who work every day to administer, manage, and secure it. These professionals are risk managers by nature, and adapting to the situation, implementing contingency plans, and finding creative solutions is a hallmark of election administration.Yesterday I was once again inspired by the resilience and security that our election officials have built into election administration, and I am proud that CISA and our federal partners stand with them in this no-fail mission of defending our democratic process.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












In 2021, we established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to bring together industry and government partners with new and challenging goals: enable persistent, trusted partnerships that address the most urgent current risks, and drive long-term, proactive planning. This second goal was particularly unique; never before had the U.S. government sought to engage in joint planning with the private sector around shared cybersecurity challenges. We’ve learned a lot over the past few years as we successfully executed a series of cyber defense plans. These include securing open source software in operational technology and industrial control systems, addressing risks facing remote monitoring and management, and enhancing security and incident response for the water sector, as well as gleaning valuable lessons on how to make our planning efforts valuable for each of our partners.Today, we’re glad to publish our 2024 Priorities. These priorities will further expand the breadth and depth of our partnership to tackle more challenging, forward-leaning cyber risks that could evolve in the future, not just the immediate risks. To be clear, JCDC in this context is not a specific team or organization; it represents the collective group of industry and government partners drawn together to drive positive change for our nation’s cybersecurity.Our 2024 priorities are defined around three focus areas. The first focus area, Defend Against Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Operations, aligns JCDC strategic and operational efforts to counter known and suspected APT campaigns that target critical infrastructure sectors with the potential to impact National Critical Functions. The second focus area, Raise the Baseline, encompasses JCDC efforts to improve the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure entities to reduce the frequency and impact of cyber incidents. The third focus area, Anticipate Emerging Technology and Risks, seeks to decrease the likelihood and impact of AI-related threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure providers.Six 2024 JCDC priorities, aligned with the three focus areas, call out specific topics for increased attention.  JCDC’s Priorities for 2024 are:Discover and defend against malicious abuse by APT actors, particularly those backed by the PRC, on and against U.S.-based infrastructure. In 2023, we saw an increase in APT activity, particularly APT groups affiliated with the People’s Republic of China, directed towards the critical infrastructure on which Americans depend. In 2024, JCDC will work with interagency and private sector partners to strengthen the ability of critical infrastructure sector organizations to prepare for and respond to future malicious activity on their networks, including activity utilizing living off the land techniques.Prepare for major cyber incidents. JCDC will work to elevate critical infrastructure's capacity for resiliency and capability for recovery in response to major cyber incidents. This includes supporting CISA’s work to update the National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP). As directed by the President’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy, CISA, in close coordination with the Office of the National Cyber Director, is gathering input from public and private sector partners to identify key changes for incorporation into the updated NCIRP. Through JCDC, CISA is working to ensure this process addresses significant changes in policy and cyber operations since the NCIRP was released and plans to publish an updated NCIRP this year.Help provide state and local election officials with information and tools to help secure their networks and infrastructure against cyber threats as part of CISA’s broader election security efforts. JCDC will support CISA’s effort to improve the security, visibility, and resiliency of the election security ecosystem by collaborating, planning, and sharing cyber threat information withJCDC industry partners, interagency partners, SLTT entities, and vendors across the elections community.Measurably decrease the impact of ransomware on critical infrastructure. The impacts of ransomware and data extortion have proven challenging and costly for organizations of all sizes. JCDC will leverage its resources and engage with partners to prioritize operational activities that actively defend against and disrupt ransomware campaigns in collaboration with government and non-governmental entities. We will also collaborate with technology providers to leverage Secure by Design principles to scale protection.Make measurable progress toward a world where technology is Secure by Design. Even as we urgently work to help organizations implement the most effective cybersecurity measures, we know that scalable change requires a fundamental shift in how technology is designed, built, and maintained. We will continue to drive measurable commitments across the technology ecosystem that reduce the number of defective technology products by design and ensure that strong default settings are the norm. In 2023, CISA announced our Secure by Design Alert series to identify recurring classes of defects that can be fixed through systemic changes. In 2024 we will continue to publish these alerts, including those developed in response to other priorities, such as discovering malicious abuse by APT actors. Decrease risk posed by AI to critical infrastructure. In alignment and coordination with CISA’s Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, JCDC will support CISA and DHS-led efforts to decrease the likelihood and impact of AI-related threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure providers.I am incredibly proud of this collaborative team and what we have accomplished, overcoming many obstacles to meet the demands of the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. Through JCDC, CISA looks forward to furthering this work with our partners across government and private sector to tackle some of the most significant cyber risks facing our country in 2024.JCDC is a public-private cybersecurity collaborative that leverages new authorities granted by Congress in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act to unite the global cyber community in the collective defense of cyberspace. CISA welcomes all critical infrastructure organizations and entities with cybersecurity expertise and visibility to participate in our collaboration efforts.

This advisory and complementary guidance provide organizations with details on how Volt Typhoon cyber threat actors use “living off the land” techniques to abuse legitimate, native tools and processes on systems, and identifies specific details on the actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) using certain adversarial behavior patterns.“The PRC cyber threat is not theoretical: leveraging information from our government and industry partners, CISA teams have found and eradicated Volt Typhoon intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors. And what we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Today’s joint advisory and guide are the result of effective, persistent operational collaboration with our industry, federal, and international partners and reflect our continued commitment to providing timely, actionable guidance to all of our stakeholders. We are at a critical juncture for our national security. We strongly encourage all critical infrastructure organizations to review and implement the actions in these advisories and report any suspected Volt Typhoon or living off the land activity to CISA or FBI.”Today’s joint advisory is based primarily on technical insights gleaned from CISA and industry response activities at victim organizations within the United States, primarily in communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater sectors. Our complementary joint guide is derived from those insights as well as previously published products, red team assessments, and industry partners.The new advisory and guide have been jointly issued by CISA, National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), a part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ).For more information, visit People's Republic of China Cyber Threat.About CISA As the nation’s cyber defense agency and national coordinator for critical infrastructure security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to the digital and physical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day.Visit CISA.gov for more information and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram.

The ongoing support and assistance that CISA provides to all levels of government is laudable!CISA: Where do you see the communications landscape in the next 5-10 years?Answer: As previously mentioned, NG-911 will provide both the dispatch centers and the on-scene first responder with more real time information. FirstNet and other cellular providers will continue to get more robust and provide additional data and other tools. The current and next generation of public safety personnel are “digital natives” and will bring new perspectives to our leadership as they advance through the ranks. Ten years from today the mission-critical public safety radio on the first responders’ belt will still be their most utilized tool as they do the jobs demanded by our public!CISA: SAFECOM strives to be an active partner to the public safety community at the federal, state., local, tribal, and territorial levels. How are you working within the community to highlight the SAFECOM program?Answer: In addition to bringing back and implementing best practices at our countywide level, I continue to be active in both the Ohio SIEC and our 12-county regional interoperability committee, and share knowledge gained in SAFECOM at both of these levels. My phone is always on and I remain committed to move forward each day to better serve the public, and especially provide the tools for our safety personnel to do their jobs more effectively and safer!In closing, CISA’s ongoing, unflagging support of SAFECOM has made the progress in the public safety mission critical communication move ahead exponentially since 2001. CISA leadership and rank-and-file remain dedicated to serving our county and are commended by our SAFECOM membership!! THANKS, CISA!!!

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












Our team at CISA often receives questions about why creation of a “security.txt” file was included as one of the priority Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs). Why is it so important? Well, it’s such a simple concept, but it provides great value to all of those involved in vulnerability management and disclosure.When security researchers and bug hunters uncover vulnerabilities in an organization’s ecosystem, how do they even know who to reach out to? Without clear reporting channels, researchers may be unable to quickly discern where to report vulnerabilities – meanwhile the organization remains vulnerable to attackers. However, there is an opportunity for all organizations to overcome this obstacle in line with CISA’s guidance through a simple text file - the security.txt file.Earlier this year, CISA launched the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) program, which proactively discovers and notifies organizations of their exposure to internet-accessible vulnerabilities used in ransomware attacks. This is a proactive program used to enable organizations to take early mitigation measures before an incident occurs. Our current notification process can be hampered by the inability to find appropriate point of contact information for organizations. According to a recent study, only about a half of a percent of the world’s top one million websites publish a security.txt file. The lack of this simple file leads to multiple emails and phone calls to the organization, delaying the notification process and the organization’s awareness of the critical need to mitigate their risk to ransomware.In an effort to accelerate the delivery of all notifications, CISA supports using the “security.txt” standard to streamline notifications and reduce the risk of compromise. It not only helps our work but also supports other partners that try to warn organizations of internet-accessible vulnerabilities susceptible to cyber threat actors – this is most important for organizations aligned to our most valuable critical infrastructure sectors. For those that don’t already know, the security.txt is a proposed Internet standard, RFC 9116, which concisely advertises an entity’s vulnerability disclosure process. Like robots.txt, this machine-readable file resides on a public-facing webserver, either in the root or “well-known” directory, where security professionals and researchers can quickly identify the entity’s preferences for reporting vulnerabilities. Each domain and subdomain within an entity’s network should have its own security.txt file.CISA’s security.txt file resides on our public-facing domain, at https://www.cisa.gov/security.txt (this will redirect, per our canonical):Contact: mailto:ContactOCIO@cisa.dhs.govExpires:  2024-10-01T00:00:00.000ZEncryption: https://www.cisa.gov/contact-usHiring: https://www.cisa.gov/careersGenerally, security.txt files should contain the following information:ContactHow researchers should contact entities to report security vulnerabilities, such as email, phone number, or a web page. Entities should list contact methods by order of preference, with the first being most preferred.RequiredExpiresDate and time after which the data contained in the "security.txt" file is considered stale and should not be used.RequiredEncryptionLink to the entity's public key (like OpenPGP) for researchers to encrypt communications with the entity.OptionalCanonicalCanonical URIs where the “security.txt” file is located.Example: Canonical: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/security.txtOptionalAcknowledgementsLink to a page where security researchers are recognized for their reports and collaboration.OptionalPreferred-LanguagesComma-separated list of natural language in which researchers can submit reports to the entity. If the field is omitted, researchers should assume the preferred language is English.

Remember to include "https://". See the full description of CSAFOptional CISA recommends that all organizations adopt “security.txt” standards. As part of the larger cybersecurity community, you can help to advance the adoption of Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) and make every American’s critical infrastructure more resilient. A small contribution to add this simple file and ensure it stays updated will make a huge impact in not only improving your own organization’s security but also the national cybersecurity ecosystem!

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












One of CISA’s most important and enduring roles is providing timely and actionable cybersecurity information to our partners across the country. Nearly a decade ago, CISA stood up our Automated Indicator Sharing, or AIS, program to widely exchange machine-readable cyber threat information. We know that the only constant in cybersecurity is change, and we’re evolving our information sharing approaches to maximize value to our partners and keep pace with a changing threat environment.How Did We Get Here?Every day, CISA evaluates the cyber threat environment, considers the impact of known vulnerabilities, and assesses the defensive posture of entities across our Nation to determine how we can most effectively safeguard critical infrastructure and government networks. Our insight is derived from a variety of sources to include classified and open-source reporting; operational collaboration with government and industry partners; findings from CISA assessments and incident response; and from information shared by members of our broad cybersecurity community through  mechanisms such as AIS.CISA then translates these insights into timely and relevant information. We share information broadly on a global scale, through alerts, advisories, and our Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. We enrich our shared services and cyber capabilities with cyber threat information (CTI). And we leverage these insights to design and prioritize new cyber capabilities for programs such as Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM). Across the board, CISA incorporates our unique insights of the global cyber threat environment into everything we offer to provide value to our partners.While these threat-informed products and capabilities are important to many of our stakeholders, we know that organizations also benefit from receiving cyber threat information to shape investment decisions and prioritize mitigation actions. It is not enough to monitor broad cyber threats generally;  organizations must apply threat information to their own risk and technology environments. AIS was established to satisfy legislative requirements and to provide stakeholder communities with a cost-effective means by which to exchange cyber threat indicators and defensive measures with CISA and, in doing so, with thousands of cybersecurity practitioners across the country and with partners across the globe. When it was first established, AIS was a novel model that helped many organizations around the world. But now, it’s time for a change.Where Are We Going?As the cyber threat environment evolves, so must our capabilities to analyze and share cyber threat information. When AIS was first designed, the U.S. Government was focused on filling an identified gap in cyber threat intelligence for many organizations and ensuring strong privacy controls. In the early days of AIS, the priority was speed. A decade later, the cybersecurity industry has matured substantially; current products and services are addressing information requirements for most organizations and, in an era of information overload, practitioners still require speed but value context, precision, and tailored insights over volume and velocity alone.In 2024, CISA will begin a strategic effort to modernize our approach to enterprise cyber threat information sharing. This effort will drive three key areas of progress:Simplification: We will refocus and consolidate our customer-facing cyber threat intelligence offerings under a new initiative called Threat Intelligence Enterprise Services (TIES). The TIES Exchange Platform will unify our information sharing capabilities under a single banner for federal agencies and certain user communities, enabling streamlined provision of cyber threat information from our partners and commercial sources. This will offer a common view which will facilitate communications and enable threat-specific engagement. As we design and implement this central solution, CISA is working in parallel to modernize our AIS capability which, in the future, will further complement CISA-curated threat feeds made available by this shared service platform.Partner-Centered Design: Throughout this process, we will be driven by the requirements of our partners, including federal agencies, critical infrastructure organizations, and state, local, tribal, territorial governments, to ensure that we are adding value rather than duplicating capabilities. We will continuously seek feedback and ensure that the platform itself is built around human-centered design principles to enable ease-of-use even for under-resourced organizations.Learning from Experience: We will rigorously learn from known challenges with the legacy AIS system: we know that it must be easy to both share and receive, that shared information must have sufficient context to enable prioritized action; and that every participant must recognize meaningful value that is additive to existing cybersecurity capabilities. At the same time, we will build upon the successes of the AIS program, including a rigorous focus on privacy and confidentiality by design.What to Expect Next?Our goal is to facilitate collective, automated cyber defense through increased sharing and context, shaped by an acute understanding of the threat environment. While CISA implements this transition over the next two years, the AIS program will remain available, and we encourage users to continue leveraging this capability and actively share indicators back with CISA.Our shared visibility into cyber threats is our best defense. When an organization identifies threat activity and keeps it to itself, our adversaries win. When we rapidly share actionable information across a community of partners, we take back the advantage. And, when we turn actionable information into strategic investments to drive the most important mitigations, we achieve enduring change. In this new year, we encourage every organization to make a commitment- perhaps a New Year’s resolution- to cybersecurity information sharing, including incident information, indicators of compromise, or even feedback and insights that could benefit peers across the Nation. We look forward to sharing more details about TIES and our cyber threat exchange modernization initiatives throughout the year. ---

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












As federal civilian agencies continue to modernize IT enterprises, increased reliance on cloud services, platform services, and external providers has introduced new types of risks. Recent threat activity from groups such as Storm-0558 have demonstrated the importance of hardening email and identity infrastructure, enabling key security capabilities such as logging, and enhancing the security of underlying cloud environments. The Administration’s Executive Order 14028 has accelerated cross-government efforts to advance cloud security practices, implement encryption and multifactor authentication, and enhance operational visibility and logging on federal government networks.  Earlier this year, CISA worked with a dozen federal agencies to apply the Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) secure configuration baselines for Microsoft 365 (M365) across agency enterprises. Using our ScubaGear assessment tool, agency practitioners implemented advanced protections and configured cloud environments to better safeguard sensitive information and secure government services against sophisticated threat actors. Though the Microsoft-specific baselines were developed collaboratively with the Federal Chief Information Officers Council to provide necessary security enhancements for most federal cloud business applications, we quickly identified that more was needed. Today, CISA takes another step forward by releasing the SCuBA project’s Google Workspace (GWS) secure configuration baselines along with our new assessment tool, ScubaGoggles. Developed in close collaboration with Google, these materials are specifically designed to assist federal agencies with securing GWS environments and leveraging native security capabilities to enhance an organization’s overall cyber posture. However, every organization, public and private, can benefit from the security recommendations and best practices outlined in the GWS Baselines and should consider whether their current baseline requires enhancements in light of the evolving cyber threat environment.CISA requests public comment on the GWS baselines and the ScubaGoggles tool to help ensure our products enable necessary security improvements to keep pace with evolving technologies while considering the challenging cyber threat environment. CISA’s GWS Baselines draw upon the success, lessons learned and expertise gained from the M365 Baselines project to apply a consistent and comprehensive approach to securing GWS cloud environments. Once finalized and fully implemented, the GWS baselines will reduce misconfigurations and enhance the protection of sensitive data, bolstering overall cybersecurity resilience. These baselines provide a collection of tailored security controls for nine core GWS services. They cover key GWS components, such as safeguarding collaboration on Google Meet, securing data stored in Gmail or protecting sensitive information in Google Drive and Docs.  The GWS series includes minimum viable secure configuration baselines for: Groups for Business Gmail Google Calendar  Google Chat Google Classroom Google Drive and Docs Google Meet Google Sites Google Common Controls  The publication of the GWS and M365 Baselines will further CISA’s mission to secure the federal IT enterprise while also serving as a resource for all organizations leveraging the two most widely-used business platforms. Users across the Federal Government and beyond rely on these cloud-based business applications daily to communicate and store sensitive information and conduct critical business functions which is precisely why these systems remain such prime targets for malicious actors. Our goal is to help organizations secure their work, keep confidential information private, and empower cybersecurity teams to harden these environments and gain operational visibility within these cloud-based business applications.  Along with seeking public comment from all interested stakeholders, CISA asks federal agencies to help validate and enhance the automated implementation of these SCuBA Baselines. Agencies interested in coordinating with CISA to help refine the baselines, implementation guidance, and the assessment tool should email CyberSharedServices@cisa.dhs.gov.  Please send all comments on the GWS baselines via email to CyberSharedServices@cisa.dhs.gov by January 12, 2024. The baselines are available for download on CISA’s GitHub or at CISA.gov/SCUBA.

This September, my first child entered kindergarten, which, of course, was fraught with both trepidation and excitement. Along with normal questions about peer relationships, physical safety, health, and after-school care, came an added layer of digital safety. Obviously my 5-year-old doesn’t have a credit card or a 401K, but the K-12 sector has grown to be increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks, including data breaches and ransomware. While we aren’t dealing with a child’s retirement plan, these attacks have led to compromises of students’ personal information, exposure of school security information, class disruptions, school closures, and loss of already-strained financial resources – all of which harm our children and families.  In recognition of the K-12 cybersecurity challenge, the White House’s Back to School Safely: Cybersecurity for K-12 Schools Summit in August brought together school administrators and educators and a coalition of industry and government partners that committed to strengthening K-12 cybersecurity. CISA and Department of Education jointly released the K-12 Digital Infrastructure Brief: Defensible and Resilient—highlighting the leadership imperative to treat education infrastructure as core to our nation’s security. The brief urges school vendors and suppliers to build their systems, used by thousands of school districts across the country, with robust security settings by default at no additional charge and align with Secure by Design principles. Prior to the summit, CISA held a workshop with the education technology vendors scheduled to attend the White House summit to discuss challenges for the K-12 community and present Secure by Design, a CISA initiative co-sealed by 17 U.S. and international partners.  In support of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, Secure by Design is a movement aiming to shift the responsibility of digital security from the most vulnerable and least equipped (cash-strapped school districts, for example) to the most capable (software manufacturers). When we hear about cyberattacks, we often hear about what the villains did right and what the victims did wrong, but we do not hear about the vendors who use materials and methods that result in software with well-known defects.  Malicious and nation-state cyber adversaries have demonstrated countless times that they can easily find software defects and use them to steal money and data and lock up critical systems. As software weaknesses and mitigation studies over the past decade have found, it’s not so much a technical issue as it is one of political will and economics. As David Rice notes in Geekonomics: The Real Costs of Insecure Software, until we address the economics of software insecurity, we will not fix the problem. What does this mean? In the political sense, it’s the set of decisions that a governing body, (i.e., federal government, state legislatures, and local school boards) makes that prioritize cybersecurity as an outcome. From an economic sense, it’s understanding the value decisions made by each market player to create interventions that meaningfully shift the decisions and behavior of those players to value digital security. In this case, we are seeking to move the responsibility upstream to the software vendors, so we must take an ecosystem approach that factors in the challenges and opportunities faced by all the players. The K-12 community is a unique ecosystem unto itself, and our workshop was aimed at identifying the challenges and opportunities specific to the community. Schools must address a dizzying array of social and academic issues on exceedingly tight budgets. Allocating funds for recommended cybersecurity protections, such as Single Sign-On and Multifactor Authentication (MFA), is necessarily weighed against other investments that provide for the needs of children and educators. In our workshop, we heard that credential-based attacks, for instance, are a huge issue for the sector. Yet, participants said enabling MFA, one of the best tools for preventing unauthorized access to systems, too often remains a challenge in K-12. Since technical support provided by school systems to end users is often limited—and not every school can count on reliable cell phone coverage—administrators and educators may be reluctant to deploy MFA to vulnerable users. Moreover, in the education context, one’s phone can be considered a distraction in the classroom or a luxury that not all can afford. So, our goal is to identify what technological and policy innovations the government, private sector, and civil society can develop and deploy to address these challenges.  Because thousands of school districts in this country (in which staff, teachers, students, and their families are all players) are responsible for their own digital security, we will always be at an asymmetric disadvantage. And whereas schools are run at the local level, the expertise and resources available to safeguard critical systems and sensitive data are in short supply. There is simply no way we can expect school districts, whose primary objective is to ensure the learning and safety of schoolchildren, to bear the cybersecurity burden alone.  What if we shifted more of the responsibility of digital security from schools onto a relatively small number of K-12 vendors? Security could scale to those thousands of school districts, and each party could capitalize on its respective comparative advantages. Studies have shown that cyber innovations that scale are the ones with the greatest impact.  Certainly, education technology software developers face key challenges too, but cybersecurity issues facing K-12 could be much more effectively and cheaply dealt with earlier in the supply chain, by focusing on a relatively smaller number of linchpin companies serving very large numbers of students and educators instead of school district by school district, school by school. K-12 vendors need to hear about the security demand from school customers and school procurement processes must include security practices as a critical factor in their decision-making.  In turn, vendor security teams need further investment in tooling, training personnel, user experience, and secure software methodologies, all of which stem from executive-level business decisions. A company-wide plan for following Secure by Design practices to bolster commitment to customer safety should be the ultimate outcome. Given that most companies are in their initial stages of the journey, sharing success stories, best practices, and aggregate data can lead to the widespread adoption of Secure by Design principles and demonstrate the return on investment. CISA is proud to count eleven education technology vendors that have committed to Secure by Design, designing products with greater security built in, an increase of five since we started this voluntary initiative. We are excited to work with them and take this journey together toward safer software. I’m personally and professionally invested in this movement to strengthen cybersecurity for our schools. If you are too, and want to take the pledge or have questions about how to ask your school’s education technology vendors for security by design and default, please join us at K-12 Education Technology Secure by Design Pledge.

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












In October 2022, CISA released the Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to help organizations of all sizes and at all levels of cyber maturity become confident in their cybersecurity posture and reduce business risk.Earlier this summer, CISA outlined four CPGs that organizations could implement as first steps towards better cybersecurity. While we continue to urge every organization to incorporate these fundamental cybersecurity practices, we are encouraged to see and share a few positive trends we’ve identified since they were released.In line with our Cybersecurity Strategic Plan and our focus on measuring risk reduction, CISA is measuring national progress in adoption of CPGs and associated progress in addressing key risks.Recently, CISA identified positive trends on two CPGs across nearly 3,500 organizations enrolled in our Vulnerability Scanning service before April 1, 2022. The two CPGs are: Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (CPG Goal 1.E) and No Exploitable Services on the Internet (CPG Goal 2.W). Of note, these CPGs are particularly important in reducing the likelihood of damaging intrusions across for IT and OT networks.Reduction in the Average Number of KEVsPrior to the release of CISA CPGs, the reduction trend in the average number of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) was not consistent. Since the release of CISA CPGs, the organizations enrolled in CISA’s vulnerability scanning service consistently decreased the average number of known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) on their networks – the reduction average was almost 20–percent.Figure 1: With publication of the CPGs, organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning continued to demonstrate reductions in KEVs on their networks.This decreasing trend shows the progress toward the recommended action of “patching or mitigatingThis decreasing trend shows the progress toward the recommended action of “patching or mitigating KEVs on internet-accessible assets” within this CPG.Progress in Removing Exploitable Internet ServicesFor organizations enrolled in our vulnerability scanning service, CISA looked for trends in public-facing assets with exploitable services on the internet before CPGs and after CPGs were published. CISA identified that the vast majority of exploitable services exhibited modest declines (1-percent or less) among enrolled organizations.Figure 2: Organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning demonstrated continued incremental progress in removing exploitable internet services since the CPGs were published.Specifically, slight reductions were observed in services such as remote desktop protocol (RDP) and remote procedure call (RPC), which are common attack vectors threat actors use for initial access, ransomware distribution, command and control, and data exfiltration.Impact of Using Vulnerability ScanningOrganizations enrolled in CISA’s vulnerability scanning continued to show progress with a reduction or maintained an average number of KEVs exposed per entity and gradual reductions in the percentage of entities exposing exploitable internet services.  CISA anticipates continued progress toward CPG implementation and risk reduction among organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning.Figure 3: Organizations enrolled in vulnerability scanning since the Shields Up initiative started, publication of CPGs, and CPG update and start of Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP).From April 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023, enrollment in CISA’s vulnerability scanning service increased nearly 69% - more than 5,900 participating organizations.On average, newly enrolled organizations decreased their vulnerability exposure by 20-percent within the first three months of vulnerability scanning.  Moving ForwardWhile these trends are progress in the right direction, CISA acknowledges that there is room for improvement - this is only the beginning. Moving forward, we plan to periodically update and expand our analysis of trends that will allow us to track progress and focus our collective efforts on areas that require attention.CISA also plans to introduce new services and capabilities to simplify CPG utilization and enhance our ability to track national and sector-specific progress.When an organization uses the CPGs, CISA and our partners can help them understand the specific things they need to do to effectively reduce the specific risks they have identified. Our regional cybersecurity advisors are a valuable resource that can help organizations with assessing their cybersecurity and implementing CPGs.What You Can DoSince the CPGs were released, we’ve taken steps to encourage adoption, from the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP) and the Shields Up campaign to our CPG Assessments.  These are intended to achieve a simple goal: to encourage adoption of CPGs and reduce the prevalence and impact of cyber intrusions affecting American organizations.We are taking this journey together and we welcome your contribution. Organizations should consider enrolling (and staying enrolled) in our vulnerability scanning service and conducting a CPG Assessment, a module within our Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET). This assessment can be self-administered or carried out with a regional CISA Cybersecurity Advisor.If your organization possesses data relevant to CPG adoption, we invite you to let us know about it by reaching out to us at vulnerability@cisa.dhs.gov.Editor’s note: This blog is not a product of the DHS Office of Homeland Security Statistics or the CISA Statistical Official. Operational data presented in this blog reflect trends identified across organizations enrolled in CISA’s vulnerability scanning service consistent with our commitment to measure and drive risk reduction across our partners.

Schools provide the foundation for our nation’s future success and are an essential component of our everyday lives, providing services to millions of children, families, and communities across the country. K-12 schools are also part of our nation’s critical infrastructure. To ensure the safety and wellbeing of students, educators, and staff, schools must be aware of risks and threats, create and implement actionable security plans, and be able to withstand and recover from incidents. This month marks Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, an annual effort led by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) focused on educating and engaging all levels of government, infrastructure owners and operators, and the American public about the vital role critical infrastructure plays in the nation’s wellbeing and why it is important to strengthen critical infrastructure security and resilience.Recently we’ve witnessed increased frequency and intensity of threats and hazards facing our critical infrastructure, from natural disasters to targeted violence to cyberattacks. This year, CISA asks everyone, including the education community, to Resolve to be Resilient by preparing for and investing in resilience today, so we can withstand or recover quickly in the event of an incident tomorrow. CISA takes seriously our commitment to school safety and supports K-12 schools and districts in their efforts to enhance school security and build resilience. Together with our Federal agency and non-government partners, we develop actionable guidance, evidence-based practices, tools, and more to help educate, equip, and empower school leaders to foster change and be better prepared for an evolving threat environment.In recognition of Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, here are some of the ways schools can build resilience through CISA resources:Take steps in advance to prevent potential incidents. CISA partnered with the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center to develop the K-12 Bystander Reporting Toolkit, which offers simple strategies and guidance K-12 schools and school districts can use to implement and enhance safety reporting programs.Assess risks and their potential impacts. CISA created the K-12 School Security Guide Product Suite to provide K-12 districts and campuses with resources, tools, and strategies to evaluate vulnerabilities, strengthen security, and better protect school communities.Examine and test safety processes and plans through exercises. CISA Tabletop Exercise Packages are a comprehensive set of resources designed to assist schools and districts in conducting their own exercises and initiating discussions within their organizations about their ability to address a variety of threat scenarios.Address systemic cybersecurity risk. CISA’s Cybersecurity for K-12 Education provides tools, information, and resources to protect against attacks by malicious cyber actors and reduce the likelihood of successful cyber incursions.Develop sustainable capabilities to address an evolving threat environment. CISA’s regionally based security advisors assess, advise, and assist and provide a variety of risk management and response services.Create holistic school safety plans. CISA administers SchoolSafety.gov. a Federal interagency website that provides a one-stop access point to school safety information, resources, and tools on a range of topics and threats.  Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month is a time for all members of the school community to come together to advance safety efforts and recognize and champion initiatives that drive down risk and build resilience. This means doing the work up front to prepare for and adapt to changing risk conditions. This month and throughout the year, CISA reiterates our commitment to helping school communities across the country maintain safe, secure, and resilient learning environments.For more information and helpful resources for the school safety community, visit CISA’s School Safety page.

With an evolving threat landscape, infrastructure security remains a priority at all levels of government and the private sector. November kicks off Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is highlighting how critical infrastructure stakeholders can “Resolve to be Resilient” through proper planning. This month’s resiliency campaign highlights the integration of processes and practices into a response plan that anticipates disruption to infrastructure and reduces recovery time.Some keys to safeguarding our infrastructure include preventing, protecting against, responding to and mitigating the use of explosives against both public and private sectors, which is the mission of CISA’s Office for Bombing Prevention (OBP). According to the 2022 Explosives Incident Report (EIR), a joint product between CISA and the United States Bomb Data Center, 2,538 bomb threats were reported in 2022—a 35% increase from 2021. The EIR also revealed a 23% increase in explosion incidents between the two years (from 785 to 966).As part of this month’s designation, CISA OBP is engaging with stakeholders nationwide on the impact of bombing incidents and threats to critical infrastructure. This effort includes training and resources to reduce the risk of an attack. CISA OBP’s approach improves capabilities to protect critical infrastructure, which spans everything from healthcare, water, and education to chemical, transportation systems, energy and much more.  CISA OBP’s Associate Director Sean Haglund reminds us, “Part of our society’s collective benefit is the protection and resiliency of critical infrastructure. While we cannot guarantee that an attack will never take place, we can work to minimize the potential impact through proper planning and coordination.” He adds, “Mitigating risk to our nation’s infrastructure is a fundamental component of national security, and we thank all of our partners for their efforts in its protection.”To learn more about CISA’s November activities highlighting Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, check out Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month | CISA. For more on CISA OBP, including access to free training, awareness products and more about OBP’s mission, visit Office for Bombing Prevention | CISA.

In the fast-paced world of cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats is essential. And while security is without a doubt a priority for businesses of all sizes, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by all the information available. At CISA, we have been diligently developing a solution aimed at simplifying the way our partners and potential collaborators understand their cyber risk and prioritize their investments, ensuring they can quickly navigate this complexity with ease. Our focus has been on making the process of working with us more intuitive and user-friendly so that every organization can spend more time meeting business goals and less time sifting through cybersecurity resources. We believe this approach will be especially helpful for smaller to medium sized stakeholders with fewer resources, who need help prioritizing actions to help them to reduce the likelihood and impact of damaging intrusions.In early 2024, we look forward to launching a new way for organizations to understand their cyber risk and receive targeted, straightforward guidance built around our Cybersecurity Performance Goals. This new tool is called ReadySetCyber. While we’re not quite ready to unveil all the details just yet, we are excited to share a glimpse of what’s on the horizon.ReadySetCyber will simplify the process of incorporating cybersecurity into your organization’s business decisions, regardless of your level of expertise or the number of IT personnel you have on staff. Instead of making cybersecurity a daunting challenge, with the ever-present question of where to invest next, prioritization decisions become a guided, step-by-step process on a user-friendly interface accessible to organizations of all sizes. By providing tailored resources and insights in a streamlined format, ReadySetCyber will empower users to align scarce resources with the most impactful cybersecurity measures for their organization.Our approach to ReadySetCyber begins with baselining your organization’s current cybersecurity maturity, based on your input to a dynamic set of questions, then providing actionable strategies, tools, and resources to mitigate risks effectively, along with a direct connection to your regional CISA cybersecurity advisor. We plan to launch ReadySetCyber in a beta capacity, while iteratively implementing improvements over time, using your valuable feedback as our guide. The questions for ReadySetCyber will be submitted for public comment before the end of the year, setting it up for public use in early 2024. This approach will help ensure we are not providing a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather tailoring our application to suit your unique needs.ReadySetCyber is about leveling the playing field and enabling our wide variety of partners to make measurably effective risk reduction investments. Our aim is to simplify and streamline access to the right information, ensuring that every organization can make informed decisions to enhance their digital security.

Chemical Security,                                                                                 Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience 












November is a big month for Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Chemical Security every year. It marks the anniversaries of CISA’s two cornerstone chemical security programs, as well as the anniversary of CISA as an organization, and it is also the nation’s Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. Under normal circumstances, the CISA Chemical Security team is hard at work every November celebrating the annual accomplishments of our teammates, developing strategic plans for the coming year, and setting new programmatic milestones to keep the American people safe and secure from the threat of chemical terrorism.But 2023 is not a normal November for CISA Chemical Security. This summer, Congress allowed the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program’s statutory authority to expire, leaving our nation without a regulatory chemical security program for the first time in 15 years. Rather than celebrating the program’s 16th anniversary Nov. 20, we are facing a more somber milestone: today marks four months since the expiration of the CFATS program.As we call on all Americans to Resolve to be Resilient, we are also testing our own resilience within the CISA Chemical Security family. CISA continues to urge Congress to reauthorize the CFATS program. CFATS provides essential resilience for the chemical industry by enabling chemical facility owners and operators to understand the risks associated with their chemical security holdings, develop site security plans and programs, conduct site inspections, coordinate with local law enforcement and first responders, and continue to reevaluate each facility’s security posture based on changes in its chemical holdings and threat nexus. We at CISA follow our own advice: we believe in putting the right security plans and countermeasures in place before an incident occurs to reduce the risk of incidents occurring and improving resilience during and after incidents to reduce the impact on our communities and our nation. You can learn more about these security and resilience principles through CISA’s Shields Ready campaign, which includes four key pillars:Identifying Critical AssetsThrough CFATS, CISA screened more than 40,000 chemical facilities, identified 3,200 of those sites as high-risk, and worked with those facilities to understand the risks posed by their chemical holdings and develop appropriate security plans. CISA was constantly monitoring the landscape of dangerous chemicals across the nation as individual facilities tiered in and out of the program based on increases or decreases in these chemical holdings. Without CFATS, our agency no longer has an accurate national profile of the locations of these dangerous chemicals. We estimate that over the past four months, a minimum of 200 new chemical facilities have already acquired dangerous chemicals that ought to be more carefully secured; other facilities could be stockpiling these chemicals in excess of their existing security precautions, increasing the risk of terrorist exploitation.Assessing RiskThe ability to screen personnel is an essential component of security when a chemical facility is deciding whether to grant an employee unescorted access to dangerous chemicals or critical assets. Under CFATS’s Personnel Surety Program, chemical facilities could submit names of personnel with or seeking access to dangerous chemicals and critical assets; CISA would then vet those names against the Terrorist Screening Database. As of July 2023, CISA was conducting terrorist vetting on an average of 9,000 names per month. Based on this rate of vetting, CISA estimates that in the past four months, facilities have had to make decisions on granting access to about 36,000 employees without their being vetted beforehand by CISA for terrorist ties. Prior to the lapse in authority, CFATS identified more than 10 individuals with possible ties to terrorism over the lifetime of the Personnel Surety Program. Given that rate of vetting, CISA likely would have identified an individual with or seeking access to dangerous chemicals as a known or suspected terrorist at some point over the past four months. We cannot sound the alarm loudly enough: every day this program is offline is too long.Security PlanningUnder CFATS, chemical facilities were required to develop site-specific security plans to mitigate the risks associated with possession of dangerous chemicals. Without CFATS, we cannot inspect high-risk sites or assist these facilities with security planning efforts unless they approach the agency voluntarily for an assessment via the ChemLock program. We were conducting an average of 160 site inspections every month under CFATS; of those, more than a third identified security gaps, which were then added to site security plans for remediation. We can safely estimate that hundreds of security gaps have gone unidentified since July, meaning that chemical facilities are operating with no knowledge of these gaps or guidance on how to address them.Continual ImprovementCISA Chemical Security and the high-risk facilities previously regulated by CFATS worked together to ensure continuous improvement and adapt to the changing threat environment. Through regular and recurring CFATS compliance inspections, we were able to provide lessons learned and best practices to address emerging threats and challenges and, based on the performance-based nature of the regulation, require facilities to amend security plans to account for these risks. This, in conjunction with updated guidance and resources, helped to ensure continuous growth in the chemical security community. Prior to the lapse in authority, this process was going to be further enhanced by a proposed rulemaking effort to enhance the physical and cybersecurity standards required of CFATS.For facilities, the steady continuity of the CFATS program meant that they could project their security budgets years in advance; this is why CISA has traditionally supported long-term program reauthorization. Reliable and reasonable regulation bolsters resilience by allowing industry to make wise choices and build security into their budgets. Suddenly allowing the program to expire with no alternative in place has already led to confusion and concern across the chemical industry, reducing the chemical sector’s resilience in the face of an ever-changing threat landscape. Looking AheadFor CISA Chemical Security, resilience means showing up to work, day after day, determined to keep dangerous chemicals out of the hands of terrorists by fighting for the reauthorization of CFATS and doing everything that we can on a voluntary basis in the meantime. Our staff have been unwavering in their dedication to the chemical security mission. While the CFATS program is lapsed, we continue to offer expertise to chemical facilities on a voluntary basis through the ChemLock program, which is available to any facility with dangerous chemicals regardless of whether they were previously tiered under CFATS. Inspectors nationwide continue to offer on-site assessments and assistance, which chemical facilities may request via the ChemLock Services Request Form on the ChemLock homepage. Let me be clear, however: while the voluntary ChemLock program complements the CFATS program, it is in no way a replacement for CFATS.   We know the threat of chemical terrorism did not go away simply because the CFATS program expired. We know the best practices to protect dangerous chemicals against terrorist exploitation still work, and we continue to strive to share that knowledge with the chemical industry via the ChemLock program on a voluntary basis. But as we ask the nation to reflect on its security posture and Resolve to #BeResilient, we must face the fact that the absence of the CFATS program is a national security gap too great to ignore. As we call on the American people to examine the resiliency plans for the critical infrastructure that supports our everyday lives, we at CISA also call on Congress to reauthorize CFATS as a pillar of security and resilience for the nation’s chemical sector. This is a resolution we cannot afford to break.To stay up to date about CISA’s chemical security programs, be sure to follow CISA on Twitter and LinkedIn, and follow the hashtags #CFATS and #ReauthorizeCFATS for the latest news about CFATS reauthorization.

2025-07-25 22:17:34,426 - INFO - Đã crawl thành công: DHS CISA and UK NCSC Release Joint Guidelines for Secure AI System Development - Tác giả: integrating ‘secure by design’ principles, these guidelines represent an historic agreement that developers must invest in, protecting customers at each step of a system’s design and development.  Through global action like these guidelines, we can lead the world in harnessing the benefits while addressing the potential harms of this pioneering technology.”The guidelines provide essential recommendations for AI system development and emphasize the importance of adhering to Secure by Design principles that CISA has long championed.“The release of the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development marks a key milestone in our collective commitment—by governments across the world—to ensure the development and deployment of artificial intelligence capabilities that are secure by design,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “As nations and organizations embrace the transformative power of AI, this international collaboration, led by CISA and NCSC, underscores the global dedication to fostering transparency, accountability, and secure practices. The domestic and international unity in advancing secure by design principles and cultivating a resilient foundation for the safe development of AI systems worldwide could not come at a more important time in our shared technology revolution. This joint effort reaffirms our mission to protect critical infrastructure and reinforces the importance of international partnership in securing our digital future.”The guidelines are broken down into four key areas within the AI system development lifecycle: secure design, secure development, secure deployment, and secure operation and maintenance.  Each section highlights considerations and mitigations that will help reduce the cybersecurity risk to an organizational AI system development process.“We know that AI is developing at a phenomenal pace and there is a need for concerted international action, across governments and industry, to keep up,” said NCSC CEO Lindy Cameron. “These Guidelines mark a significant step in shaping a truly global, common understanding of the cyber risks and mitigation strategies around AI to ensure that security is not a postscript to development but a core requirement throughout. I’m proud that the NCSC is leading crucial efforts to raise the AI cyber security bar: a more secure global cyber space will help us all to safely and confidently realize this technology’s wonderful opportunities.”“I believe the UK is an international standard bearer on the safe use of AI,” said UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Michelle Donelan. “The NCSC’s publication of these new guidelines will put cyber security at the heart of AI development at every stage so protecting against risk is considered throughout.”These guidelines are the latest effort across the U.S.’s body of work supporting safe and secure AI technology development and deployment. In October, President Biden issued an Executive Order that directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions. Earlier this month, CISA released its Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, a whole-of-agency plan aligned with national strategy to address our efforts to promote the beneficial uses of AI to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, ensure AI systems are protected from cyber-based threats, and deter the malicious use of AI capabilities to threaten the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every day.

Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience,                                                                                 Cybersecurity Best Practices,                                                                                 Information Sharing 












Last Friday, I had the pleasure of joining the Treasury Federal Insurance Office and the New York University Stern School of Business’ Volatility and Risk Institute at their conference on Catastrophic Cyber Risk and a Potential Federal Insurance Response, where I announced that CISA will relaunch the Cybersecurity Insurance and Data Analysis Working Group (CIDAWG).For those familiar with the original CIDAWG created in 2014, this new iteration will look very different.   The working group was re-established to create a venue for collaboration and forward progress with industry on topics where we have shared interests–specifically, understanding what security controls are working most effectively to defend against cyber incidents. This will help organizations to better understand where to invest resources and will allow the government to ensure our future investments are making the greatest impacts. To put it simply, we want to understand what “good” looks like.Our nation’s critical infrastructure faces serious cyber risks, often accompanied by significant financial losses in the wake of a cyber incident. The digital revolution has brought much good—connecting humans around the globe in ways we never could before— however, each new digital tool and platform represents another potential point of failure in an ever-expanding attack surface.  Take ransomware as an example. Ransomware incidents can severely impact business processes and leave organizations without the data they need to operate and deliver mission-critical services. The monetary value of ransom demands has increased, with some demands exceeding $1 million. Additionally, according to the FBI’s 2022 Internet Crime Report, there was a 60%  increase in ransomware attack complaints (from 1,493 in 2018 to 2,385 in 2022), with ransomware losses exceeding $34.3 million. This is a lower bound that does not include estimates of lost business, time, wages, files, or equipment, or any third-party remediation services. With respect to cyber incidents broadly, the FBI report showed a 49% increase in losses from $6.9 billion to $10.3 billion over the same period.To address this crisis, we need to understand how to effectively combat the threat. That’s where the CIDAWG comes in. When we re-launch the CIDAWG in December, the working group will partner with Stanford’s Empirical Security Research Group, a research lab in Stanford’s Computer Science Department, with the intent to correlate data with cybersecurity controls to understand their effectiveness. CISA will ask working group members to collaborate with Stanford to improve analysis of the aggregated, anonymized loss data and link it with controls effectiveness. This analysis will be a resource both for insurers to inform their risk analysis and for CISA to better understand whether efforts like the Cyber Performance Goals (CPGs) and the Secure by Design initiative are translating to reduced cyber risk exposure for organizations that adopt them.At its core, CIDAWG will be a key part of a larger effort by CISA and federal agency partners to combat ransomware. CISA has many tools to support this effort, including the Joint Ransomware Task Force, the Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot, and the Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative.  The Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative receives tips from the cybersecurity research community, infrastructure providers, and cyber threat intelligence companies about potential early-stage ransomware activity that can lead to early notifications to head off potential attacks.In addition, CISA continues to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which directs CISA to issue regulations requiring covered entities to report to CISA covered cyber incidents within 72 hours after the covered entity reasonably believes that the covered cyber incident has occurred and report ransom payments within 24 hours after the payment has been made. It’s critically important that entities report cyber intrusions, including ransomware incidents, to CISA or the FBI as quickly as possible. Reporting incidents allows CISA to quickly share information that can protect other organizations, limiting the ability of malicious actors to use the same techniques to execute multiple intrusions.In short, achieving the goal of driving down cyber risk, as stated in the National Cybersecurity Strategy, requires coordinated action across the United States Government, the private sector, and American society. Everybody has a role to play in cybersecurity…and we need everybody to play their role. I look forward to relaunching CIDAWG and working with our partners in the coming months to help collectively drive down cyber risk, improve the threat landscape, and prevent future cyberattacks.

In recent years, cyber attacks have intensified in both volume and impact–affecting the day-to-day operations of organizations across our nation’s critical infrastructure sectors. When most Americans consider the cyber-physical impact of attacks on critical infrastructure, they may recall when a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline’s corporate network led to a disruption of fuel supplies to gas stations along the East Coast. More recently, advanced actors such as Volt Typhoon have demonstrated the intent and technical ability to disrupt our critical infrastructure. These types of cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt critical functions on which we all depend, and in the worst cases, lead to the loss of human life.In response to this evolving threat environment, CISA is excited to announce a pilot program designed to deliver cutting-edge cybersecurity shared services on a voluntary basis to critical infrastructure entities that are most in need of support. CISA has acted as a managed service provider to the federal civilian government for years and observed significant risk reduction along with the benefits of cost-savings and standardization. Leveraging a new authority provided by Congress, we are eager to extend our support and enterprise cybersecurity expertise with non-federal organizations that require additional assistance to effectively address cybersecurity risks.Scaling CISA-managed cybersecurity services for the segments of our critical infrastructure community that need it most is a cost-effective way to gain greater insight into our evolving threat environment, establish a common baseline of cyber protection, and, most importantly, reduce the frequency and impact of damaging cyber events.Last month, CISA began deploying our Protective Domain Name System (DNS) Resolver to pilot participants which, until now, had only been available to federal civilian agencies. It is a proven, cost-effective solution that uses U.S. government and commercial threat intelligence to prevent systems from connecting to known or suspected malicious domains. Since 2022, CISA’s Protective DNS service has successfully blocked nearly 700 million connection attempts from federal agencies to malicious domains across the globe and continues to reduce the risk of the most common cyber risks like ransomware, phishing and malicious redirects. In short, CISA is broadening the use of our highly scalable Protective DNS service to ensure "Target Rich, Resource Poor” critical infrastructure entities have access to some of the same cybersecurity protections which have proven foundational to enterprise risk reduction across the federal government.Through this pilot program, we are identifying critical infrastructure entities interested in leveraging CISA-provided commercial shared services, stress-testing our service delivery mechanisms, and demonstrating our ability to acquire, deploy, and operate these cybersecurity services at-scale. In alignment with CISA’s ‘Target Rich, Resource Poor’ strategy, our teams are working with critical infrastructure entities in the healthcare, water, and K-12 education sectors in our first phase of deployment. This year, we plan to deliver services to up to 100 entities.As part of this Cybersecurity Shared Services Pilot program, CISA is hosting roundtables and information sessions with critical infrastructure partners in every region and across all sectors. We want to understand their unique needs and challenges, identify gaps in existing capabilities, assess interest in our shared services, and identify ways CISA can provide more scalable support through shared services or other means. The insights obtained through these discussions and as a result of the Protective DNS pilot will inform our effort to better serve our nation’s critical infrastructure organizations.As America’s Cyber Defense Agency, we believe the ability to provide cost-effective, highly scalable, and innovative solutions to critical infrastructure entities in need of assistance is vital to our national cyber mission. As the cyber threat environment continues to evolve and the potential impacts on everyday life become more real, the need for collective cyber defense  increases. CISA stands by to support these entities and is prepared to answer the call.We look forward to expanding the list of participating entities and available shared services throughout the next year. If your organization is interested in participating in the no-cost critical infrastructure pilot commercial shared services program, or know someone who is, please contact a security advisor at a CISA Office in your region.

Applying “Secure By Design” Thinking to Events in the News

Cybersecurity Best Practices 












In October, CISA and 17 U.S. and international partners released a refined version of “Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software.” The update expands on the three principles outlined in the original version: Take Ownership of Customer Security Outcomes, Embrace Radical Transparency and Accountability, and Lead From the Top. The whitepaper urges technology manufacturers to adopt "secure by design" principles in their manufacturing processes and highlights several tactics to make products safer by design. Both before and since we posted that paper, numerous news outlets have reported on potential threats facing consumers and the technologies they rely on every day. One such threat, humorously dubbed "juice-jacking," even received some lighthearted commentary on US talk shows. For those who missed it, the reports claimed that criminals were rigging free USB charging stations in US airports and other public spaces. Since USB cables can charge a phone as well as transmit data, the perpetrators allegedly exploited this capability to install malware on victims' phones. Reading these articles prompted us to consider how "secure by design" thinking could be applied to analyze the alleged problem. The reports didn’t cite evidence, but some key questions related to these alleged juice-jacking attacks could help determine if manufacturers need to do more to protect their customers: Manufacturer response: What do phone manufacturers have to say about the vulnerabilities linked to these alleged attacks? Did phone manufacturers commit to fixing the problem?  If so, by what date?  Hardware: Is a specific hardware manufacturer or version of device more vulnerable than others? Operating system: Does  the threat affect a particular mobile device operating system, e.g. Android phones, iPhones, or both?  Are fully updated phones affected, or just those with outdated software? Device settings: Are there settings or configurations that can prevent the attack? If so, how can users adjust these settings to enhance security? Will the manufacturer make the secure setting the default in future versions? Detection: Can users detect the start of an attack? For example, does the phone detect a potential problem and ask the user to approve a data transfer? If so, is the wording in the dialog clear enough for the user to take appropriate action? If not, will manufacturers create or improve confirmation alerts? Can users determine if an attack has been successful? Can they check their phones for signs of compromise from a juice-jacking attack? Malware: What does the alleged malware do once installed on a phone? Does it steal passwords, mine cryptocurrency, or delete photos? Does the malware bypass normal OS authentication requests, or are users merely clicking "Accept", thereby giving the malware access to important files and data? Have any malware reverse engineers examined the malware to figure out its origins and purpose? I have not seen answers to these questions nor have I seen any evidence that juice-jacking is even occurring.  Despite the reports, the FCC notes that it is not aware of any confirmed cases.  That’s not to say juice jacking is impossible. Any code can have security defects and unsafe defaults, and phones are built from millions of lines of code. There may be vulnerabilities that make juice-jacking possible. But there is a difference between attacks that are possible, those that are probable, and those for which we have evidence of active exploitation. We should be careful not to jump from “it’s possible” to “it’s happening”The security of consumer and enterprise products are not acts of fate. Security is the result of many conscious and continuous choices made by manufacturers starting even before products are designed. Customers and journalists can influence those choices in favor of better security in many ways, including by asking the kinds of questions above. In doing so, we shift the conversation away from what the attackers might be doing to their victims, to what the manufacturers are doing to keep customers safe. We should frame the debate in terms of empowerment (“Manufacturers have made these improvements”) rather than continue to imply our helplessness, (“Attackers are doing X”). Simply put, manufacturers must develop products that are secure by design rather than putting the burden of safety on customers. Finally, for folks in a position to give security advice, please orient your guidance around the principles and tactics in the secure by design whitepaper. Ask yourself, who is your intended audience?  Are you addressing the customer or the manufacturer? If you give advice to customers, please consider giving corresponding advice to the manufacturers so that they can fix the problem upstream and eliminate the need to warn customers in the first place. It’s more effective to advise a few manufacturers than it is to instruct millions of people to overcome the dangers of unsafe products. The road to a “secure by design” world will be challenging, but it is possible. One of the first steps on that journey is to accept the very idea that technology products can be made safe, and to ask manufacturers to make security a conscious and continuous choice as they build and maintain their products.

Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience 












November is Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, and this year CISA is calling on all Americans to Resolve to be Resilient. Critical infrastructure is a shared resource as well as a shared responsibility – we all play a role in keeping it secure – but underserved and under-resourced communities often face the same threats to critical infrastructure security with fewer capabilities to address them.  This is a big problem. To have a truly resilient nation, we need all communities to be resilient. Beyond threats from bad actors, underserved communities are more likely to have outdated or crumbling infrastructure and to have to deal with infrastructure related health issues--like what happened to the water in Flint, Michigan—or be more vulnerable to cyberattacks. We’ve also seen the news how extreme weather has increased the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, and underserved communities are often affected disproportionately, reflecting a further need for resilient infrastructure that can withstand these changes.  Fortunately, new resources exist that can help. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law in November 2021, allocated hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade for roads, bridges, transportation safety, clean energy, and other major projects.  CISA partners with communities nationwide to help them understand their risks and take advantage of the many resources available at no charge through CISA. In addition to tons of resources, we offer regional support in the form of technical assistance and training. State and local governments as well as critical infrastructure operators can also use CISA’s Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework (IRPF) to better identify critical infrastructure, assess related risks and develop and implement resilience solutions. Further, we encourage you to determine whether your community qualifies for funding through the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, and to review the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals, which provide guidance to help prioritize security investments toward areas that will have the greatest impact on your cybersecurity. Even as we ask all communities to Resolve to be Resilient this November, we are continuing that focus on resilience through the “Shields Ready” campaign launched on November 7 and continuing year around.  Inevitably, our nation will continue to face new and evolving threats and disruptions, whether from natural hazards or other physical and cyber threats. But by doing the work up front to prepare for disruptions to our communities and critical infrastructure, whether at a personal, organizational or governmental level, we can all stay a step ahead. This means knowing the risks, preparing and exercising a plan with a deliberate focus on continuity, recovery, and minimization of downtime, and then continually learning and adapting. We understand that underserved communities face additional challenges than most other communities, both in dealing with more outdated infrastructure and in having fewer resources to address them. That’s why CISA wants to make sure communities are aware of all the resources at their disposal to enhance resilience.  To learn more about how you can be more resilient, please visit cisa.gov/cisr and cisa.gov/shields-ready

As the National Coordinator for critical infrastructure security, CISA is launching the Shields Ready campaign during Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month to improve the resilience of infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “By taking steps today to prepare for incidents, critical infrastructure, communities and individuals can be better prepared to recover from the impact of the threats of tomorrow, and into the future.” “When our infrastructure partners in the public and private sector are prepared, their communities are able to respond better and recover faster after disasters,” said FEMA Administrator Criswell. “We are excited to partner with Director Easterly and our colleagues at CISA on their new Shields Ready campaign. In coordination with FEMA’s own Ready campaign, this new approach will help us encourage critical infrastructure stakeholders to practice preparedness and build a more resilient nation by creating plans to protect people and communities alike against hazardous events.”This focused approach highlights how critical infrastructure entities and other organizations can Resolve to be Resilient by integrating certain practices that will make themselves secure, resilient, and able to bounce back quickly and build back stronger from an incident, entities should: Know Your Infrastructure and Dependencies. Organizations should identify their most critical systems and assets for their operations and understand their potential dependencies on other infrastructure systems that enable the continuity of their own operations.Assess Your Risks. Consider the full range of threats and hazards that could disrupt your organization’s infrastructure operations and evaluate specific vulnerabilities and consequences the threats and hazards could pose.Make Actionable Plans. Organizations should develop both a strategic risk management plan to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities identified as well as actionable incident response and recovery plans to help withstand disruptions and rapidly restore operations within minimal downtime.Measure Progress to Continuously Improve. Exercise incident response and recovery plans under realistic conditions and periodically evaluate and update strategic plans. An organization’s ability to prepare for and adapt to changing risk conditions starts with fostering a culture of continuous improvement, based on lessons learned from exercises and real-world incidents.For more information, please visit: CISA.gov/ShieldsReady.
